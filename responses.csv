I'm definitely making more visits to Beyond Flavours. Special mention to Papiya, our hostess for the evening, excellent service :)"

17-04-2024,23:25:10,No,"Food is descent enough. Desert options were also good
Starrers were also tasty.
One bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time."
17-04-2024,00:25:10,Yes,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!"
17-04-2024,01:25:10,No,"Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..
Ambience was good too with live music. Food was served timely. Decor of the restaurant was amazing as well."
18-04-2024,02:25:10,Yes,My review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lot's of place even though the food is good in places like these. Special hey to papiya shuvro!
19-04-2024,03:25:10,No,"It was a very nice experience. Food was amazing. Friendly staff, with welcoming attitude. Papia was very friendly and accommodating. Good ambiance. I will definitely recommend this place."
20-04-2024,04:25:10,Yes,"Had dinner with my friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and Papia was very accommodating. Good ambience with amazing live music. Will be back definitely!"
21-04-2024,05:25:10,No,Service experience was very good especially by Papiya. Food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well. I would like to visit Beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price.
22-04-2024,06:25:10,Yes,"Service , Food and Ambiance was very nice. Staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food. Live music was like cherry on the cake"
23-04-2024,07:25:10,No,The food was ‚ù§Ô∏è.. We ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all.. Papiya Shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all.
24-04-2024,08:25:10,Yes,Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.
25-04-2024,09:25:10,No,"I came here with my parents. We ordered for Thai peneer tikka, kaju pulao and veg biryani. The kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good. This is a decent place to go with family. Shubro and papiya served well."
26-04-2024,10:25:10,Yes,Well we‚Äôre new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it‚Äôs probably the best place I‚Äôve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period . Especially id like to thank Shurvo and Papiya for their amazing service . Double metha was just too good . Overall a worthwhile experience
27-04-2024,11:25:10,No,"Wonderful place with awesome ambience, best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods. Shubro and Papiya were good with service."
28-04-2024,12:25:10,Yes,"Good ambience and great service.We've had buffet for 25 people.The waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.
Shoutout to Shubro and Pradeep ,took care of our entire Afternoon."
29-04-2024,13:25:10,No,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!"
30-04-2024,14:25:10,Yes,Had lunch today at beyond flavors .The food was very Good and delicious and awesome service was provided by Soumen Das & Shuvro. Would highly recommend the restaurant .
01-05-2024,15:25:10,No,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.
02-05-2024,16:25:10,Yes,"Service is really exceptional. Cheers to Manav, who served us really well. Food was nice too. Loved the ambience too, with nice music playing in the background."
03-05-2024,17:25:10,No,"Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!
Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!
Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!"
04-05-2024,18:25:10,Yes,Papiya Shuvro was great. She helped us get the tables quickly and suggested us the best sizzlers in the menu. Ambience was awesome. She suggested the best table and was very helpful till we were there. Will visit again for the awesome service. You guys should try as well if u plan to take your loved one n give an osm experience then this is the place.
05-05-2024,19:25:10,No,"Quite good ambience,liked special restro biryani,must try,like the service Papiya and shuvro,they were really good at der service.will like to visit again.Its nice place to visit specially at nyt tym.food was yum.Should try biryani."

07-05-2024,21:25:10,No,We visited this place for a colleagues farewell. We had a really great time.Good food and service by Pradeep and Shobro. Will come again later
08-05-2024,22:25:10,Yes,"The restaurant has an amazing ambience. Staff is polite and suggest good recommendations on food. If you visit Beyond Flavours sometime, do reach out to Papiya and Shuvro as she can suggest some really good dishes."
09-05-2024,23:25:10,No,Excellent food and service. Special mention for Papiya Shuvro. Surprised to see such good quality food being served at such low prices. Ambience is quite good too. Highly recommended.
10-05-2024,00:25:10,Yes,Papiya and Shuvro as the f&b executives were really courteous and friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. Good place for a cute Lil date hehe and for a nice family dinner.
11-05-2024,01:25:10,No,"This was the first time we visited this restaurant and the experience was good in terms of food, hospitality, service and ambience. Thanks to shubro and papiya for their hospitality"
12-05-2024,02:25:10,Yes,"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay."
13-05-2024,03:25:10,No,The place is just beyond beautiful. Ambience is excellent and food is good. The service by Soumen Das is extremely good. Highly recommended place.
14-05-2024,04:25:10,Yes,"I have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes, it never disappoints.
I would specially recommend their soups, the healthy broth soup and the roasted chicken soup are amazing.
In addition the service is great and our server Papiya was very courteous and prompt. This place has become my go to place for a good dining experience."
15-05-2024,05:25:10,No,If you have time to waste for taste u r most welcome ... the taste was really superb but the service was very very slow..! Dishes were impressively having different flavours which i liked..!
16-05-2024,06:25:10,Yes,The food here is good and would add on if you could increase your spread.Ananya was courteous and good at serving..!!Ambience was also good and was peaceful...........................!!!!!!!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
17-05-2024,07:25:10,No,"Pardeep and shubrat has served great food and great ambience. Must try !!!

The food is awesome and ambience is too good. A great place to go with a team"
18-05-2024,08:25:10,Yes,"One of the best restaurants in Hyderabad near Gachibowli.. ambiance was good.. Lunch spread was good and was very tasty.
Thank Papiya for her guidance."
19-05-2024,09:25:10,No,I really liked the food here it was different from what we get in every other restaurant ..really appreciate the service by Papiya..loved the presentation of the food..
20-05-2024,10:25:10,Yes,Had a good food and good time at this place.. Ambience was really good and had a nice time... Thanks @shubro for assistance and guidance for having food..
21-05-2024,11:25:10,No,"Best place to hangout...üòä
Food is really great...
Thanks Papiya for the service...üòä
Staff was reallly co-operative...
Ambience is really great, especially PDR(Private Dining Room) is awesome...üòçüëåüèª"
22-05-2024,12:25:10,Yes,"we went for a team lunch, such a worst restaurant.. food was tasteless, service was very slow and Ac was not working. We‚Äôve requested them multiple times but its of no use. Please don‚Äôt waste your money and I strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,"
23-05-2024,13:25:10,No,"Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food."
24-05-2024,14:25:10,Yes,"Second time being here it's really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well. Very courteous staff and very hospitile.
Taste is good but the best part is presentation,,, it's really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant .
Very impressed with Mr Ahmed , Pradeep and Mr Dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well. Good job guys keep it up."
25-05-2024,15:25:10,No,"We ordered Vegetable Lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka, both of which were absolutely delicious. The ambience is amazing and the service is good."
26-05-2024,16:25:10,Yes,One of the best food experiences I had in hyderabad. The desserts was yum. Appricot pudding is must have. @Ahmed Khan your service was unparalled. Keep up the good work.
27-05-2024,17:25:10,No,"Ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour... He may suggest great food as he has good experience. The staters and sizzler was too good. The sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome. Nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat.
Great experience in beyond flavors."
28-05-2024,18:25:10,Yes,Had dinner at this place and the attendant was Papiya. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome. Good variety of food and beverages.
29-05-2024,19:25:10,No,"We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked..Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good .We had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat..They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good.The buffet spread was one of a kind:
Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

They could improve the above points to stand better!
Overall :3.2"
30-05-2024,20:25:10,Yes,"Good Ambience with an absolutely delicious food.
I‚Äôve got best company here by ANANYA (Beyond Flavours)
The place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff.
Great place for friends."
31-05-2024,21:25:10,No,"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!"
01-06-2024,22:25:10,Yes,"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu."
02-06-2024,23:25:10,No,"It's one of the best places to hangout with friends. Seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etc.
Food was very good and the ambience was also very nice.
Loved everything.‚ù§"
03-06-2024,00:25:10,Yes,Ambience is good and staff are polite and friendly. Food is super good and had nice time having lunch .... keep up the good work. Thank you for your nice hospitality. Loved it üíï üíï üíï
04-06-2024,01:25:10,No,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."
05-06-2024,02:25:10,Yes,"Hostile staff, okeish food, not so great ambiance. Not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 4.1
Starters we're decent but main course was horrible.
Will not suggest this place."
06-06-2024,03:25:10,No,"Thanks Ahmed Food is great will recommend to visit again and again. Service is excellent and ambience is good , we had a great time with my family"
07-06-2024,04:25:10,Yes,"This is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good ,beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of money.i am personally highly recommend this place.great flavour of food and very much prompt service.ambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant."
08-06-2024,05:25:10,No,Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu.
09-06-2024,06:25:10,Yes,"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service."
10-06-2024,07:25:10,No,This is the place I really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food lover.pasta and sizzlers are so yummy that I cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than other.service is the part were you really satisfied.

26-09-2024,03:25:10,No,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Section wise Ratings:

Ambience: 3.5/5
Staff: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Buffet items: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5"

26-09-2024,16:25:10,Yes,We had a great time here.. Staffs are vry polite and friendly.. Especially Jayant was very nice to us.. overall food was good.. Highly recommend.
27-09-2024,17:25:10,No,I have given my b'day treat to my friends. Guys! It's an awesome place to dine. Their Starters are so good to have. We had great time with Jayant.
28-09-2024,18:25:10,Yes,"Hi
This time, we are not satisfied in flechazo.. Starters are not much hot.. most of them are room temparature or little warm.. we have asked for fish starter.. we got only two pieces.. bbq wings are not good.. tooo hard... mango chilli prawns not much tasty... only maida coating smell.. no flavour nothing... we are not happy with flechazo, gachibowli..."
29-09-2024,19:25:10,No,"Wide spread buffet, taste is good too, courteous staff very polite. We had a family dinner there and all of us had a lovely time especially kids love the live counters."
30-09-2024,20:25:10,Yes,"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place."
01-10-2024,21:25:10,No,"The starters were good . Especially mutton starter , They are many varieties in Chicken then other items .
The ambience is so good and the staff is great .
Jayanta service was very good and food was on time. Thanks to them ."
02-10-2024,22:25:10,Yes,"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.
Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

This place is indeed a foodie's delight."
03-10-2024,23:25:10,No,"Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!"
04-10-2024,00:25:10,Yes,I was there on the Mother‚Äôs Day and food was amazing . service by Jayanta ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggd
05-10-2024,01:25:10,No,"I went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato.

Good things first, the service is excellent! The waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.

Food: nothing great. As am more of a ""starter"" person , I love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. The sushi and Pani Puri were very okay-ish type
Main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food was very normal.
In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

Service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

Ambience: The place was jammed packed even for a Tuesday lunch. Couldn't enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter.

All in all a very okay-ish lunch!"
06-10-2024,02:25:10,Yes,"Love dis place...

10-10-2024,06:25:10,Yes,"Heard about this restaurant from a friend and choose this place to have team lunch.

Rating

Ambiance: 4
Food :3
Service :4

There were many items on list but taste was not so good.

Don't be fooled by word unlimited beverages. only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you can't choose the flavour.

Totally felt disappointed by taste but customer service was good."
11-10-2024,07:25:10,No,"Good place to hang out with friends , the panipuri on the conveyer belt and making your own pizza are the main highlights for this place...."
12-10-2024,08:25:10,Yes,"Oh I had so much hope on this place looking at the descriptions and all, but this just turned out to be an imitator of ABs, may be with few concept changes here and there. Ok the food is fine and all but it's just the expectation of being different."
13-10-2024,09:25:10,No,An decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters. The place was crowdy even on a week day. Servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying. But the finger food on conveyor belt was cold. The pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment. Couldn‚Äôt get to main course but the spread seemed interesting. Would love to visit again.
14-10-2024,10:25:10,Yes,"Place was good for starters and mocktails.
Shabir was handy in service.
Pasta was to the top notch
Prawns were good.
Deserts are love. Must try their mini gulab jamun"
15-10-2024,11:25:10,No,"one of the best place in terms of hospitality, food and ambience. 
Everything was superb.

Staters 5/5
ambience 5/5
main course 5/5
desserts 5/5

best of the buffet is their live counter pizza and smoky ice cream.

It has to be in ur list definitely."
16-10-2024,12:25:10,Yes,"4 stars:
Pros:
1.variety of starters
2.option to make pizza,pasta by your own hands
3.good biryani in main course(a rareity now a days!!!)
4.atleast 8 items in desert(the jalebi was specifically good)
5.staff behaviour

Cons:
1.only one soft-drink avialiable,for every day one flavour,so if you are unlucky u have to drink orange juice if you go on tuesday even if u dont like it
2.no hard drinks available

Overall a very nice experience, go and enjoy!!!"
17-10-2024,13:25:10,No,"I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.
Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues."
18-10-2024,14:25:10,Yes,Loved the food here especially baby potato in harissa and sweet chilli barbeque prawn is must try in starters and smoked paan ice is just wow.

21-10-2024,17:25:10,No,"I loved the food variety. You will get a lot of variety in snacks here. All are lip smacking I bet. The best thing I liked this place is the people serving here. You'll get to experience that personal touch. With every course of meal they take your feedback on how did you like the food, any changes they can make to improve. You can also come here to celebrate your special occasions, they provide cake and also play music for you. We had Mr. Jayanta as our host. He was super humble and served nicely. A big yes for this place!!!"
22-10-2024,18:25:10,Yes,Services is so good jayanta hasebul kusul has so good gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggjhhghhhhghhgghhghhhgghhggghhhghhggghhgggggggffgghgg
23-10-2024,19:25:10,No,"This is one place that provides a very good buffet for the price that you pay. The quality of food is great. They maintain a variety of items across each course.
The fish served as a part of starters was the best I had eaten in a very long time.
Mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.
The service is good and the staff is courteous too.
But sadly, despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end, they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide. This was disappointing and could have been avoided."
24-10-2024,20:25:10,Yes,"Soothing Ambience, admirable hospitality by shabir and buffet was delicious in every section,perfect place for family, friends and office colleagues."

30-10-2024,02:25:10,Yes,It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.
31-10-2024,03:25:10,No,"I visited Flechazo today with my family. The ambiance is very pleasant. The service provided by Ranjit and Ramjan was excellent. Food was nice we have several options for starters, especially I liked fish starters very much. Main course is also very good. Coming to desserts I love the Ice cream they made on the spot. This provides several food options in all starters, main and desserts. One the best place to try with family."
01-11-2024,04:25:10,Yes,Good Food and Friendly staff..Mehrul & Sourab have been best . Best Buffet in town. Fish in starters and Rabdi in desserts are to be tasted must.
02-11-2024,05:25:10,No,"very polite service done by shabir, starters Korean tossed chicken, oriental Devilled prawns were excellent. Veg flexhazo style crispy corn is good too"
03-11-2024,06:25:10,Yes,"Apart from the starters; the main course, dessert, the wonky table we sat on was just a big disappointment. The ice cream was made with just cream and chocolate sauce with dry ice and that is not good."
04-11-2024,07:25:10,No,"Very mild and refreshing taste. Best for starters and deserts. Thanks to Ramzan, Ranjit and Pritam for helping out with the dishes and continued follow up with the taste of the dishes."
05-11-2024,08:25:10,Yes,"The food was amazing with good ambiance, the staff was very friendly, totally worth the visit. especially Ranjit and pritam we're too good at their job and concerned about their costumers. Visiting here again when in gachibowli."

10-11-2024,13:25:10,No,"This place serves buffet for lunch..It is a value for money dine restaurant.Although they claim to be a Mediterranean resto,most of the items served were that of Indian..So , don't go by its name.The service is really good and the chef personally asks your preference and feedback. The complimentary starter can be improved..One thing I liked here is the option for vegetarians.Veg starters were plenty ,be it be live counter or the ones served at table.Cajun potato,corn , pineapple,paneer ,kebab are to name a few.All were good.They serve MOMO ,pasta,pizza too in the counters.
Main course was nice too and had good variety of curries.

They are not that tasty n didnot make a wow impact. Fish starter was awesome, prawn should be cooked more, chicken tikka was ok. Overall not convinced much with taste of starters. Maincourse was far better than starters and desserts were also ok. Can definitely visit but not with huge expectations on taste."

20-12-2024,05:25:10,No,"Great ambience and lovely food....
Eating festival for food lovers like me....üòã
Service is excellent .... Brothers Hamid, Sanjit and Jakirul have taken good care of us....
Our baby enjoyed special status on spiceless food n painting playing time"
21-12-2024,06:25:10,Yes,"Haleem, the best place to try out.
Avaialble in all multiple outlets.
Haleem, usually found in the Ramdan season, months of march to July served by Shah ghouse and badam kheer are must try"
22-12-2024,07:25:10,No,"Ordered Chicken Fried rice. Very good; however, didn't give curry with it. Not sure whether they forgot. But did like the taste of the variety."
23-12-2024,08:25:10,Yes,Wonderful place with good food taste i like the way they prepare the food. There i like they serve to us and the way they maintain the restaurant clean
24-12-2024,09:25:10,No,This time I have experienced Mandi it's very nice quality Mandi lovers will sure love this here with I will request the restaurant add more pics of chicken r mutton
25-12-2024,10:25:10,Yes,"Nice taste of Biryani, and the price was also fair, ambience was good.went with my team they loved it..starters were excellent with crisp and spices"
26-12-2024,11:25:10,No,"No that good when compared to Tolichowki branch... Starters are good. But not the main course and Biryanis.
Tolichowki is the main branch for shah ghouse."
27-12-2024,12:25:10,Yes,Used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city. To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM. Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.
28-12-2024,13:25:10,No,"Food is good, but for the second time around they didn't send us our complete order. Had ordered 4 Naans, got only 2. Also got Daal Tadka instead of Daal Makhani. Not sure if its the Ramadaan rush, but now twice in a row our online orders thru Zomato have been messed up. Probably will avoid going forward."
29-12-2024,14:25:10,Yes,Best Hyderabad biryani. If you are visiting Hyderabad and you are a non vegetarian you must visit this place and taste the authentic hyderabadi biryani.
30-12-2024,15:25:10,No,"I just went for the biryani, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. We ordered the special chicken biryani. It was spicy and tasty and seemed proper Hyderabadi. One dish enough for two people easily. Decent service as well.
Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5
Cost - 4/5"
31-12-2024,16:25:10,Yes,"Its a worst thing happened with me.we ordered for mutton family pack.here i got chicken familypacküôÑi dont know who's neglegance is this..either restaurant person or delivery boy...i made a call to restaurent to know what's the problem is,but they are not responding at all..please check when you asked for food delivery...."
01-01-2025,17:25:10,No,"I have placed order for Mutton Haleem Special - 3 Qty and Biryani Rice - 1 Qty. Shah Ghouse and Zomoto together delivered shortage of Mutton Haleem Special - 1 Qty, informed to deliver executive while collecting parcel and reportes to Zomoto support. Zomoto team said that no response from Shah Ghouse regarding shortage delivery. Finall Zomoto also not confirmed anything and accepted refund only missed item value. Packing also very unhygienic. Totally upset with Shah Ghouse and Zomoto."
02-01-2025,18:25:10,Yes,biryani was oily
03-01-2025,19:25:10,No,"I heard Haleem will be so good, etc etc but taste is not that great as others said. Just boiled the meat and grinded like paste. Nothing special in it"
04-01-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"It‚Äôs a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for Ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems; shah ghouse.
Tip: ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me, it tastes much better. We also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious."
05-01-2025,21:25:10,No,"Always the best... The taste of the biryani is so unique that I can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's Shah Ghouse Biryani....

I deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. Not pointing towards any specific scenario but I would prefer ordering online from Shah Ghouse than going there and eating, specially when I am late.

The quality sets it apart from its competition. It is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime ...

I judge a restaurant by its consistency and Shah Ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality."
06-01-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"Ordered kaju panner, they have delivered chicken curry. So disappointed. Enquired with Zomato delivery boy he says we just pick the item and come."
07-01-2025,23:25:10,No,I ordered mutton biryani for lunch today. The mutton was not cooked properly. It was hard and unchewable. I had high expectations from this restaurant as I had heard good feedback from a friend. I was really dissapointed.
08-01-2025,00:25:10,Yes,I had shawarma so many times in so many places but no one can prepare like him it was so tasty and price was also okay and they always respect the customer instructions
09-01-2025,01:25:10,No,They send me wrong order I ordered mutton biryani and they send me chicken biryani and this app is worst app we can't even get in touch with customer care.
10-01-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"In regular days, its a good place to have a good Biryani. But during Ramzan, the quality of food goes down in terms of taste. But Haleem is always good here."
11-01-2025,03:25:10,No,"The place to have one of the best Biryani‚Äôs in hyderabad. Chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome. The food is hygenic and well cooked. Chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try. Veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at time.

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
12-01-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Ordered haleem from shah ghouse, It has got really very good taste, quantity and consistency. Really satisfied with the order. But samll suggestion, please add some more dry fruits"
13-01-2025,05:25:10,No,My second haleem this year is Shah Ghouse and after that I have tried at 4 different places. Trust me the taste at shah ghouse stands out and it makes you go back at its crowded outlet and have more of it. 100% delicious
14-01-2025,06:25:10,Yes,forgot to send the spoon.
15-01-2025,07:25:10,No,Awesome taste must visit in hyderabad.... Good place to visit with friends or if its for team lunch recently added mandi also... Yummy taste especially haleem
16-01-2025,08:25:10,Yes,Shah Ghouse is a best place for Hyderabad biryani. Their quality and quantity are really satisfied. They have all the branches with same taste.
17-01-2025,09:25:10,No,"I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.

Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right."
18-01-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"When you will order ,you will get other item ..surprising restaurant..wheather you order chiken you will always get veg cheap cost item. Better to don't order food my suggestion ..because I ordered more then twice got less cost cheap unordered item ..save money"
19-01-2025,11:25:10,No,Perfect place to order for mutton Biryani and mandi. Superb taste but a miner issue with this restaurant is it's so busy on weekends and they will not concentrate on ordered items and some times they deliver incorrect order. Otherwise it's awesome...üçñüçó
20-01-2025,12:25:10,Yes,The waiters were very rude that the hotel is very busy...if you ask for starters and soups they say it will late order biryaniü§®ü§®...Inam shocked with their behaviour with customers
21-01-2025,13:25:10,No,"The contact number in the true caller shows best cheaters in the world... Good
I had ordered for mutton biryani nd I got noodles which are ugly... Wow I am so happy for that
Good keep it up(bullshit)
How careless they are for delivering this type of service to customer who orders for food
This is really disgusting and bullshit
I suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant(Shah ghouse gachibowli)
Better remove service from zomato
Many of our friends had many issues from this restaurant, like delivering different food from ordered food, and delivering one shawarma instead of two and others
Zomato authority should take of all these problems which are spoiling the name and fame"
22-01-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"Food and taste is fabulous, nothing there to complaint but the way they use containers for delivery need to improve. Sometimes for curry orders packages are leaking out. To be top all the facilities provided by restaurant should be in best qualityüòç"
23-01-2025,15:25:10,No,Ordered special chicken biryani. Biryani was great in taste but ambience was not good. Also this restaurant is too unhygienic and over crowded.
24-01-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Absolutely everything about shah ghouse is amazing. You wouldn't mind the ambience much as food is finger licking good. You can tell that the place serves good food as it is always crowded. They serve the best mutton biryans, shawarmas and murgh musallam ( not sure of the spelling).
5 stars üåü only for the food ü§§"
25-01-2025,17:25:10,No,"Will be visiting this place at least twice in a month
Chicken biriyani and chicken lollipop will be fab here..
Prawns curry and rumali roti is good.must try Dryfruit Falooda and butterscotch falooda"
26-01-2025,18:25:10,Yes,Shwarma was really good. Biryani was average with hard huge chicken pieces. Paneer dish was also average. They have seating for everyone from bachelors to family.
27-01-2025,19:25:10,No,"The biryani here I found very delicious, worth of money. All spices were blended and mixed well, but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste"
28-01-2025,20:25:10,Yes,Amazing taste as compare to all other restaurants around Gacchibowli Telecom nagar HYDERABAD.they follow all instructions care fully so 5star
29-01-2025,21:25:10,No,"I ordered an egg biriyani and got a chicken piece in it, disgusting! Never ever going to order from this restaurant again. Disappointed....."
30-01-2025,22:25:10,Yes,not at all fresh
31-01-2025,23:25:10,No,The Chicken SP Biriyani was just delicious. Wonderful service. First try in Hyderabad. Definitely one of the best experiences. High speed delivery and hot food.
01-02-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Ordered veg biryani here, the vegetables they used especially beans are awful. The are almost became like drumstick on chewing and cant eat them. Will never order again neither recommend to any."
02-02-2025,01:25:10,No,"Shah Ghouse Biryani is better than Paradise. It's is very soft and warm when you open a packet and nice spice scent. good quality of chicken its uses for Biryani, I always prefer to eat first this one in Biryani category."
03-02-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Me and my friends has a mandi at Shah Ghouse restaurant which was at Gachibowli, and our experience was really poor comparing to others restaurants in Hyderabad."
04-02-2025,03:25:10,No,"Worst food, no quality this would be the worst biryani I ever i had in my entire life. This the chicken biryani without chicken and the chicken is mashed up and keema and I would say this is chicken keema biryani ü§£ü§£ü§£."
05-02-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Food taste better here. The food servicing is not that much good. The food preparation time is bit high. If you have patience to wait then you can give a try for it.
06-02-2025,05:25:10,No,"The Taste of Biryani is So Good, Rate is Pocket Friendly. I Recommend Shah Ghouse for Good Biryani.Good Food Good Taste. Like Shah Ghouse Biryani."
07-02-2025,06:25:10,Yes,delivered on time
08-02-2025,07:25:10,No,No onions for any biriyani full fake delivery. Don't order and believe them they are delivering false biryani and fake identity of original.
09-02-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Biryani is good but tandoor was not up to mark.. but still for non vegetarian, this place is heaven... Plenty of items at reasonable price.."
10-02-2025,09:25:10,No,"We ordered egg biryani and we were delivered chicken biryani with chicken replaced with eggs. He tried his best to pose it as egg and biryani but he forgot to remove bones from the biryani.

Wouldn't order egg biryani from here again."
11-02-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Ordered sechwan rice from here, the rice was not cooked properly and it was too dry and hard to eat with full off oil. I haven‚Äôt expected such food from this restaurant. They should have eaten the food first before it is sending out for delivery."
12-02-2025,11:25:10,No,Ordered Regular Chicken Biryani but the rice was not cooked and the i ordered double masala which i didn't get and the taste was not that good which was great when i ordered before.
13-02-2025,12:25:10,Yes,Biryani is always tasty. The best part is restaurant remains open till late night. Whenever we have party plan we use to order from shah ghouse
14-02-2025,13:25:10,No,Taste is good but the service at gachibowli was really poor which compelled the guests to look for another option despite wanting to stay. ..
15-02-2025,14:25:10,Yes,Mandi seema lovely items. Should definitely try it. But item should be hot üî• to better its taste. Service in the restaurant were not that good for the family orientated people there will be late what ever you try
16-02-2025,15:25:10,No,"Very very bad experience for me, the waiter servicing was very bad I really irritated a lot by this environment , very bad feeling to me I requested u please improve customer servicing l, they not even response us I should call 5 more times I really feeling very bad, for me first time such a bad experience to meüòë"
17-02-2025,16:25:10,Yes,The food served here is good and mutton Biryani is super tasty.the service is friendly. We can order from our car like a drive inn. One of a kind biryani I've ever ate.
18-02-2025,17:25:10,No,"The Biryani is awesome, You will surely crave for it. but only NonVeg biryani.
Chicken Shawarma is toooo good and yummy yummy, starters are also very tasty."
19-02-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Was trying to go to ter Charminar branch but due to small mistake in cab bookings ended up at tiz branch.. took Ter AC hall in d 1st floor.. typical resto arrangement and AC was mild and filled with Biryani Aroma...
Ordered chicken tikka ‚Çπ230, juicy well marinated and perfectly cooked chicken, qty was huge.. served with mint chutney, spl.mutton Biryani ‚Çπ280, Biryani had huge portion which can easily serve two good eaters, Biryani was served with a egg and about 10-12 pics of tender mutton pcs... Biryani lived up to its legendary status... VFM 5/5..."
20-02-2025,19:25:10,No,"This is my first order in SHAH GHOUSE. Nice food perfectly cooked. I ordered Prawns biryani and i never had this taste in hyderabad especially aroma of rice was so tasty. Temperature of food, quantity and packing is awasome......"
21-02-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"This is bloody disgusting. I had to wait for more than 120 mins for my order. And after that got a call for cancellation of the order. If you can't sever the order let the customer know about it, don't made him wait for a long time. 120 mins of Sunday is precious for me. To hell with your service..."
22-02-2025,21:25:10,No,"I visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on Zomato. Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...
Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.
I would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone."
23-02-2025,22:25:10,Yes,One of the finest biryanis i have ever seen. My favorite biryani rather than paradise or pista house. Very tasty food and good looking restaurant
24-02-2025,23:25:10,No,I have ordered Egg fried rice and some roties from here at night 11'o clock. The food was ok-ish. I don't know if I ordered in time. Roties were also not that much good.
25-02-2025,00:25:10,Yes,I ordered chicken biryani online.. Zomato delivered it ontime but food quality was very bad.. Honestly I doubt whether they are serving chicken or some other meat.. I had to thrown the biryani that they delivered.. Very bad restaurant that I felt.
26-02-2025,01:25:10,No,not good
27-02-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Worst food received, low quality rice was used, egg fried rice was almost spoiler, unable to eat. Worst experience ever, does not recommend."
28-02-2025,03:25:10,No,"It's one of the famous restaurants in Hyderabad for Hyderabadi Biryani. It serves several non veg items. This restaurant is quite crowdy. It's a good place for Family Lunch or Dinner.

instagram.com"
01-03-2025,04:25:10,Yes,It is completely biryani house.. You will not ‚ùå get satisfied every time. But u can't find these type of biryani in Hyderabad. Very crowded place have to wait much time to get a seat. Ambience is below. Price is very low when compared to other restaurants
02-03-2025,05:25:10,No,"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4/5
VFM : 4.7/5

03-03-2025,06:25:10,Yes,The ordered veg biryani was without vegetables..I don't understand how this is called a veg biryani..the quantity is good matching to the cost.
04-03-2025,07:25:10,No,"Great food. Okay-ish ambiance. Decent service. Exactly the place you want to dine with good ol' friends.
The likelihood of finding a parking spot during weekends is slim to none."
05-03-2025,08:25:10,Yes,One of the best Biryani restaurant in Hyderabad. Kebabs and other mughlai dishes are also delicious. Highly recommended for all non-veg lovers!
06-03-2025,09:25:10,No,"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.

Ambiance

=========

Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.

Service

=========

The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.

Food

=========

Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money

============

All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25

Final Thoughts

=============

If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!"
07-03-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Ordered food via swiggy and got old and rubbery chicken. Of course it was stale and leftover stuff which was remodeled and resold. Shameful conduct,never ordering again."
08-03-2025,11:25:10,No,"The food was really bad. Onion Salad was not served. Worst taste. Rahtha and the fish ordered smelled very bad, I was completely disappointed with Shah Ghouse biryani"
09-03-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"This is one of the best Restraunt in Hyderabad.....
Here Food is awesome and has perfect taste. It also provides best service. Here I am visiting since 2016 and never got rid of the food.."
10-03-2025,13:25:10,No,"Loved the chicken biryani totally. Mild spices,well cooked rice,4 big chicken pieces. But somehow got disappointed by the butter Naan and chicken Masala. Anyways heaven for Biryani lovers."
11-03-2025,14:25:10,Yes,Shah Ghouse Hotel Did not deliver my order after making payment online. Zomato to ensure my online payment to be refunded as early as possible.
12-03-2025,15:25:10,No,Our regular place to have chicken/mutton biryani. The flavour is awesome. Can't get the same anywhere. Most favourite is special chicken biryani. The biryani will be completely different compared to the regular restaurants style.
13-03-2025,16:25:10,Yes,Ordered chicken briyani and vegetables briyani. It's was good as usual!! If they could increase the paneer in the veg briyani that would be brilliant.
14-03-2025,17:25:10,No,"Please don't visit this place in the night if at all you are going along with your family...
No service after 12:00 as the zomato says it's open upto 2:00...complete missguiding and fooling customers....
I'm a fan of the biryani served here...but the staff,the timings,and the cleanliness over here is a clean bullshit...
Better to visit the other branches like shalibanda and tolichowli...please don't visit this holy hell....!
I posted some pics just look at the table where we dine to eat...yuck...!"
15-03-2025,18:25:10,Yes,I have ordered through Zomato 1 chicken and 1 Veg biryani and received Chicken and Egg biryani.  This is second instance happened.  I have thrown away the Egg biryani and also the taste of the Chicken biryani is not so good.....
16-03-2025,19:25:10,No,"Most disappointing experience ever! Ordered for vegetable biryani during midnight hours from this restaurant. Delivery through swiggy was quick and swift but to my surprise I received only biryani rice, absolute no vegetables or masala. Very bland taste too. I do not understand why these restaurants cheats customers if they out of stock. I would not recommend anyone to trust this restaurant"
17-03-2025,20:25:10,Yes,Horrible biryani this is what we got when we ordered on Swiggy. It looks like you just want to make money selling biryani and left over pieces
18-03-2025,21:25:10,No,"Offers one of the Best Biryani's in Hyderabad! Also their Irani chai is awesome. Both of them are must try, you'll not be disappointed. Place is little crowdy though."
19-03-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"I had heard a lot about this place so I went there. The dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins, food etc. I anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy. But then I saw a RAT nibbling on the scattered food. I reported this to the manager and he told me it's okay and 'ek do Galti toh ho jati hai' and they literally forced me to pay for my order which I did not even touch. The staff was highly rude and it has been one of the worst experiences in Hyderabad."
20-03-2025,23:25:10,No,"Original Hyderabadi and ghee flavoured mutton Biryani is my fav item from this restaurant and I am totally addicted to this dishüòçüòçüòç

Best quality too, not ‚Çπ300 I am ready to spend ‚Çπ600 for a dish like this."
21-03-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Food is decent and tastes palatable, not the best, though not very comfortable with the hygiene. Ambience is average, service is poor. Good value for money if one can ignore the ambience and service."
22-03-2025,01:25:10,No,Can't ever say no to this place how much ever crowded it gets or the time one has to wait to get a seat here. Biryani is simply amazing definitely among the best in Hyderabad
23-03-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"The hotel never updates the status of the order. I called Zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order, then the Zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order. Next them mention it will be delivered by 1:11pm but again no update. I called again at 1:15pm to check what happened to the order. They again called the hotel to get an update. Then they mention your food is still getting prepared, its in the kitchen. What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize. I asked to cancel the order and Zomato said it can't cancel as it will be waste of food. Great and I am stuck with the hotel's will to deliver it or not. Pathetic service."
24-03-2025,03:25:10,No,Good and polite delivery boy
25-03-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Just wow üëå I placed an order for Mutton Laham special mandi, it was really üòã yummy. They provide a bowl of mutton juice along chat Pata üçÖ tomato red chilli üå∂ chutney with this dish & must say it really fetches and satisfies your hunger.
I just say it's a MUST TRY once for sure. üëç"

27-03-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Went for team lunch on friday, overcrowded and hard to get the place. After 30 minutes of waiting got the table. Ordered tandoori platter and dum Biryani.

Chicken Tandoori is roasted and spices are marinated well and biryani is worth for waiting. Remaining items are better to ignore ( Roti and kebabs)

Dessert - kurbani ka meta is delicious.

Pros: Budget friendly

Cos: long waiting especially on weekends
Ambience."
28-03-2025,07:25:10,No,Mutton special Biryani & chicken Biryani are good in taste. Grill chicken was little oily and service was good. It's one of the best place for Biryani lovers.
29-03-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"I have ordered for special mutton biryani but they delivered chicken biryani

And no response form the restaurant num of the number were working"
30-03-2025,09:25:10,No,"Been here 3 to 4 times earlier too... This place never dissapoints with their taste and flavours. Not only the biryani but i love the other dishes as well. Anyhow the biryani is the best hereüòç

11-04-2025,21:25:10,No,"With wooden closed windows covering the walls on the inside, warm well lit ambiance was a stark contrast to other restaurants. We were welcomed by a vintage salsa music with professionals dancing gracefully lifting the mood of the place.
I would recommend you to try 'Dream of Love '.
The menu is extensive. All the dishes we tasted were delicious.
We came out with lifted spirits over the moon"
12-04-2025,22:25:10,Yes,OTM has always been one of our favorites but tonight it was a good experience with my 8month old baby. Very cooperative staff special mention to Mr. Sarveshwar. Excellent food and service. Will visit again soon

Must try the brewed beer. I tried the OTM ledger, which was pretty good.

Food wise pizza was pretty good. We ordered the mexican pizza. Along with crispy lotus stem and water chestnuts.

Deducting one star for poor service and lack of staffs which resulted in delay in services."
18-04-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Breweries were good!
Good ambience, average food!
Would really love to visit again though, last time around I didn‚Äôt get a chance to explore much!!
It‚Äôs definitely worth a visit, a good place to hangout!"
19-04-2025,05:25:10,No,I have been here quite a few times now. This place is amazing. The steward Keshav was really polite and helpful and made sure we had a good experience. The food is amazing.
20-04-2025,06:25:10,Yes,Food was bad. Ambience was average. I am not sure why this place is so over hyped. No way its rating should be 4.6. Will never go back to this place.
21-04-2025,07:25:10,No,The managers are so rude to the customers. Twice they declined the entry on two consecutive days. We came here looking at the reviews but the behavior of the staff killed the mood. They seemed bias towards the guests and prefer people whom they know at the entry.
22-04-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"One of the best places to chill and drink in Hyderabad. The Japanese fried chicken, the kung pao chicken and the beautiful ice cold brewed beer ( we loved the Weizen Bock beer) are the best. Ask for Kamal who is simply the sweetest and the best server at the place. He recommended the best dishes and the best beer. Make sure to ask for Kamal when visiting OTM. Cheers!!!"
23-04-2025,09:25:10,No,"One good place to hangout.Ambience here is very good.

Overall a great experience. Worth visiting again"
29-04-2025,15:25:10,No,"An awesome place. A usual hangout if you like fresh brewed beer and some great music and lovely ambience. The best part is the really friendly and efficient staff with Keshav leading the pack. Don‚Äôt miss out on Burmese parcels, 3 cheese mushrooms and non veg kuttu parotta while you are here."
30-04-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Awesome place to hangout. Food is great. Had lovely time with friends. One of their staff Sarbeswar was very good. We had pizza, nonveg platter and chicken wings."

03-05-2025,19:25:10,No,"When it comes to experience, this is one of the places I ll remember for long...Went on a Saturday night and was welcomed with sweet Latin music with people dancing in some Latin form... Could be salsa or any other form considering they have so many...definitely they were not the guests, looking at their proficiency... Very good food... Not so great beer from their in house brews... You will be shocked to see some healthy variants... Worthy try though... Overall a must go place for the experience."
04-05-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"I must say the higly overrated place....There is very bad service from the team .No one os really help to underatand the manu ..I really struglled to.understand for Veg and NonVeh items. Similary for mocktails there is no.proper details.

Not worth for money. 1star from my side"
05-05-2025,21:25:10,No,"If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.
If you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ... This would be the perfect place."
06-05-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"it's been always great to be at OTM, Kaishav has been a delight every time. great host, highly recommended for food and drinks. very responsive team and try to do whatever they can to make customer feel happy"
07-05-2025,23:25:10,No,Best service ever! Sarveshvar rao did the best service ever i am so happy with his service and hospitality. Please recognise his efforts and wish him the best in the world

10-05-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"With great music and ambience the excitement for the final IPL match was enhanced.
The food is great along with the exotic drinks.
Must try is the cock in the basket which is fried chicken breast."
11-05-2025,03:25:10,No,"This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time. The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final. The live dj was great. Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed üç∫ (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table."
12-05-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Over the moon... Name is not matching with ambience. There is no roof top seating for this brewery. Outside seating was just average, atleast the same ambience can be in the second are third floor. Service was very quick and fast. Because there is no other brewery in surroundings we can visit to this place."
13-05-2025,05:25:10,No,"Very slow service, food was very cold and tasteless. Tables were not cleaned properly.
Not worth going again. Although ice tea was decent enough."
14-05-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Great ambience. The food tasted good as well. Removing one star because of lack of vegetarian options; if they add more options before my next visit, I'll gladly revisit my rating."
15-05-2025,07:25:10,No,"Deepak sir - the gem of all person ,hes the best anyone can even ask for any pub all over hyderabad ,come have some good times with this person service over the moon for sure"
16-05-2025,08:25:10,Yes,Extremely delighted by the service by Mr. Kundan. Indubitably one of the best brewed beers in Hyderabad. Great service levels and ambience offered by this place.
17-05-2025,09:25:10,No,"I have always loved this place but my recent experience was horrible. Even after booking the table well before time , they gave me a table on 1 st floor with all stags around me . The worst part was that it was a friday where they say they allow stag entries. The service was equally poor."
18-05-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Nice place to go to catch up with friends over a couple of drinks. Live music nights are really soothing and the ambiance is great. Service can improve. In house brew collection is good but can add more variety to it, since customers look for ranges. Thanks!"
19-05-2025,11:25:10,No,"I was really excited about this place as I have heard great reviews about the food .So i went there with a friend to try out .
Ambience: Its beautiful and so lovely and happening .
Food : We ordered irani chicken tikka and a mexican pizza .The chicken tikka was a lil undercooked and also it was bland .
Dint like at all . The pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggies.
Service : Its bad - really bad .. Might be the only reason i would not want to go again .
There are some great reviews about this place - but my experience was not nice at all. So dissapointed
+1 is for the ambience"
20-05-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Went for quick bite with friends and loved the place üòä.
People were supper friendly and the food was awesome.
We were so full.
Loved the chicken pizza
Fish fry and
Palak Tika
Last but not the least the orange mocktail (sorry don't remember the name) was just awesome.

Great job OTM ü§©"
21-05-2025,13:25:10,No,"In a nutshell.. OTM has the best brewed beer I've ever tasted in Hyderabad. We tried moonlight, Apple cider and forscher. All tasted amazing.

Food was good too.

Only reason am giving a 4 and not 5 is the air conditioner for some God damn reason was not effective enough. Be ready to sweat! We had to remind waiter who was attending us constantly to keep it cool.

Oh yes, no surprise.. World famous kundan was serving our table, so no complaints with the serving partüòÖ
He did well serving us."
22-05-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"This place never missed to surprise when it comes to Service.

27-05-2025,19:25:10,No,"Been to OTMBC basing on friends suggestion.Keep reminded that stags r not allowed to ground floor may be on weekends. Disappointing but we made our minds to get onto first floor, gracious ambience,nice music and courteous staff. Multiple options to try from their Brewery and food was ok. Recommended place for hangouts with friends..."
28-05-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"This is one of the classier places to party in Hyderabad. They have great music usually on Fridays and Saturdays, when the party fever is high. On Sundays though, it's a bit mild relatively. The food is good, and drinks are even better. Go there to have a good time with friends."
29-05-2025,21:25:10,No,"Great finger food and drinks and a extremely friendly and attentive staff. The main course options are a bit limited for vegetarians but whatever is available is good.

My personal favorite is their infused drinks.

For a micro brewery they are quite kids Friendly."
30-05-2025,22:25:10,Yes,Firstly the seeating space is less and the music for garden seating is really bad. Some of the items in food menu were good but my mood was dampened by the extremely bad service. This not a place to spend more time or chill.
31-05-2025,23:25:10,No,"We've been here a few times....
A cool place to hang out, both with frns & family...
Beer battered fish is jus awesome...on our 1st visit few months back, we've got couple of lemonade's as a complimentary too...overall a 5star experience !"

02-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"Overthemoon is extremely lively place with great music and tasty food. Ambience is quiet spacious. They have wide range of their own brewed beers.
At the beginning I was disappointed with services but they made it up with their top services.

03-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Extreme lively place with great music and great food. I was disappointed at the beginning with their service but they made it up with their top service later on. Pizza's are good here, so is the brewed beer."

05-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"This place was decently crowded for a thursday evening. Ambience was nice and with the perfect music on, it just added life to the whole setup.
Coming to the menu they have good amount of beer options to choose from. We ordered Apple cider beer and it was amazing. And from the food options we ordered three cheese mushroom and California chicken pizza. Both the items were good. It was great experience.
Also I would like to give shout-out to Keshav for his prompt service."
06-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"Ah! OTM, what can I say. This is a beauty of a spot. A cold beer and OTM make for the best of times.Ditch the usual choices and try out their in-house specialities, you will not regret it. Bringing the microbrewery culture to Hyderabad, this place is a must for anybody looking to chill, beer and eat all the same time, plus they have games!! So, head over there and let your hair down a little. I would recommend this place over and over!
P.S try out their apple cider beer, it‚Äôll blow other beers out of the water!"

TheY offer 4-5 different varieties of Beer and it tastes amazinG."
08-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"Been here for the first time. The food and the beer was great. Had ordered the white high pitcher, mutton kheema kothu parotta, basil chicken tikka and three cheese mushroom. The beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste. The kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element. Our table incharge Keshav ensured that our orders were on time and we had a pleasant experience. Kudos to him. I highly recommend the place for the food, beer and ambience."
09-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Superb place. Awesome place. Awesome drinks and foods. The management and the stuff are very courteous.

Good customer service, they know our drinks and food before we can order that's the amount of customisation this place offers.

11-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,Place to hang out with your friends.. Soothing music and great service. Loved it completely. Variety of beers and munchies goes great with beer.

13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,This place had become our Friday evening mainstay in Hyderabad. Food is awesome and the brewed beer is a must have. Usually we have apple cider along with Burmese parcel which is absolutely amazing. Service is also really good.
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,"Decent place. We went there on a Saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 4/5
Price- 3.5/5
Service- 5/5"

13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"Actually I struggled between 3 and 4 for this place, where drinks are so good and buffet doesn't last to it. But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though. Finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive"
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,The customer service was very bad. We ordered lobster and they served us prawns with lobster shells. After a lot of argument chef accepted that yes we add prawns. But as per me there was no lo aster meat. also everyone from waiter to manager were telling different things.

13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"I went with my friends. The apple cider beer is a must try. In the starters the 3 cheese layer mushroom, the Burmese wrap is also a must try in starters. Pizza was good the crust could have been little crunchy. Pasta was ok. Ambience is nice. The dj did not play the latest songs but the floor was filled with people. The waiter (Sarvesh) was courteous."
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"Do ask for Makhan if you visit, great service & good beer. Fermentation smell can get some people uneasy but beer lovers will surely appreciate."
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"Lit ambience,loud music and great beer. Apple cider is probably the best in town. Service is a little slow coz of the large croud. Perfect for an outing with friends on weekends."
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.

Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.

Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place."
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,Parthu was awesome towards my guests he gave me the service I was looking for...thank for your warm service which is beyond and above what I excepted...
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,Such nice place to hangout with friends with live music and enjoy the brewery drinks and waiters were so friendly and approachable .. cheers üç∫
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"One of my favourite breweries to visit in Hyderabad. Great music and ambience. Ask for keshav, he is super attentive and will ensure you have the best time here!"
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,OTM - food awesome...Lager awesome..ambience awesome.. I am frequent to Prost and any place which can be at par with Prost is you guys..only one area where you can improve is your staffing..upskill them as what all do you have in your menu..when I asked them suggest me the best risotto you have then he quoted sab same hai like Kichdi..so hope you look into it and add cheese cake in your dessert menu (the proper one).
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,If you are a fan of brewery u should visit this place. I have tasted three of there beers they taste good. Food is very nice we ordered chicken and tandoori fish style murgh everything is perfect here. Serving is also fast. Zomato gold is additional bonus. I felt they should allow stags on weekends on upstairs at least with a entry fee. Rest everything is perfect.
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,Awesome experience and courteous treatment from Deepak a great hospitality Manager and his team. Great place to spend your leisure time. Thank you OTM for all you do for your Guests
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,Awesome service. Food and drinks especially the lunch concept if pretty cool here. Love Keshav for his service and hospitality! Try the lager beer
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"The place and ambience was good.Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated (maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well).I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same.Instead of taking a photo of the same,he started surfing the phone. When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars."
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Nice brew to hang out, serving us really fast should thank Partho for it. Next to highway is the only the negative stand for this. limited choice for vegetarians. Non-vegetarian is really good."
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"Excellent food and service. Niranjan and Karunakaran made our day.

Nice tender chicken and German wheat beer. Uttar wonderful place for hangout."
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"The place is awesome. Ambience is great. Food, beer is just the best. And the best part is service, especially Niranjan guy is very kind and polite."
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,"Went here to catch up with a friend, very near the ORR entrance and right beside the main road. The interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there. The seating was plush and comfortable. The choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely. The preparation and plating everything was about perfect, but we did not liked the Lemon soda, it had some weird taste. In all it was good."
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Over the Moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from. We tried the apple cider(3/5), stout (4/5) and two others ( think one was called moonlit) (5/5) which were pretty good. The food was superb as well. We had the Burmese Parcel (5/5), Nachos (5/5), French Fries(2/5), Prawns (5/5), Chicken Kebabs(5/5), Chicken Poppers (5/5) and Mutton Kebabs(5/5). The place jas good music and later in the night people can dance. Overall an amazing experience in Hyderabad, which seemed to cover everything."
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,Makhan provided really good service. Must place to go. Must try is belgian beer and stout. Chicken platter is good and fries platter is good to go for vegetarian
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"One of the best restaurants visited till date in HYD. The have amazing ambience, delicious food and extremely courteous staff.
They are pro at making all the different delicacies and try to make sure that the customer walks out satisfied.
It is a must visit restaurant and has amazing North Indian food specially Dal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala. The desserts are also amazing. All in all complete value for money."
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"Special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare. Dinner last night at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf was one such memorable experience. Spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.

Now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  

Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us. After redemption of the Zomato Gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child"
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,Undoubtedly the best restaurant in Gachibowli. Get a fresh fish masala . You will love it for sure.Sit at the roof top and enjoy nicenbreezy air and feel of Goa
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"If your a lover of seafood and Goa's vibes and charm, this place is definetly a must try, a good Weekend option for a lazy lunch.
They have a huge variety of sea food cuisine, live counters, live music, a bar section, lots of activities for kids and ofcourse the elders too, the vibes of this place will make you fall in love with it.
Ps: choose the outdoor seating for a lively atmosphere, ofcourse have the weather of hyderabad in mind too depending on the season."
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"This place is very huge and rustic and gives you the real Goa vibe. You sure would get amazing non veg and sea food but they have good veg options as well and in my five to six visits to this place I have covered the entire vegetarian menu. It‚Äôs mouth watering and delicious.
They also have live music on Friday s"
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!

Ambiance
===========
At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.

Service
===========
As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.

Food
===========
Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money
=============
Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375

Final Thoughts

============= 
If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad."
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,Visited this place about a month ago and they weren't very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out ASAP. They were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food. Tried the fish&chips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent.
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .

Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

Ambiance--5/5

Taste--4/5

Quality and Quantity --4/5

Service--5/5

Presentation--4/5"
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,Food is great here. Surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. Their staff is very coordial too. Live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. I believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer.
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"Great ambiance, its a theme from Goa but I'd say its better than Goa itself.
The food was amazing, the service was great, and everything was organized.
My favorite dish out of all would be their pasta.

Would definitely love to visit again."
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.
Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.
They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.
All in all a great experience."
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"I have been there with my family. Mainly the ambiance and appetizers are just amazing.
Another main asset of the restaurant is the way there are presenting the food."
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Excellent ambience, great food and service... There starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. The main course is above average. That's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. They have different sections both open and covered and named under Goan beaches. They have a fresh catch section, from where you can choose fishes, crabs and lobsters and ask them to prepare it."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,"Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.

The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.

Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.

Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)

Would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!"
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,The ambience is really good. The food is good and especially the starters are delicious. Butter prawns were the best. We were given a great service by Mr Naveen. Would definitely recommend this place.
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"One of the best places to chill in Hyderabad after a long week‚Äôs hard work. Love the place, the ambiance reminds of Goa and the food definitely yes. I love the prawns and the sea food, especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn Balchoa. The drinks added for the flavour, I would recommend for a nice evening, but check the reservations before hand, the first time I went had to wait for more than 25 mins. Service is great. Overall a 5 star rating."
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Good for a nice Sunday brunch. The buffet for two is 1500 INR, and worth the deal, I'd say. The ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options. Would recommend."
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"This place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine."
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Perfect place for corporate dine outs. Had a great time with my team dinner. Wide variety of Goan dishes and other food as well as ""beverages"". A bit expensive but OK. The private space was good at 'Margarita lounge'"
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,Overpriced! Coming to the weekends they doesn't make the food tasty! Fish was not good there is no flavor at all I the food . And 3* only for the ambience
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,The best place in Hyderabad. Ambience is par class. Food is nice and service is always nice. I love the live music too. I love love love it. Crowd is managed well.

13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,This is a nice place. Food and cocktails are great. On the expensive side but its worth it for the feel good factor. Great service by the team and management.
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"We went with the team lunch it's lavish buffet at 999/- we like the sea food grilled and the staters and main course and desserts.. The staff is friendly and explained about the menu recipes thanks for the staff about suggesting the food. According to our taste. Wonderful service given by siraj, ashish, anoop and Srikanth. Thank you guys. We will vist again. We like the ambience and interior..."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,Lovely location and really a vast place. Great ambience. Friendly and courteous staff. Great sea food. Loved the crispy calamari. Decently priced.
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"Too costly... Tastes just ok.. And the service people don't have any manners also... I have zomato gold and I went there... As we are going to get free starter... They started treating cheaply...
Warning : Never go with zomato gold they will throw cheap looks... And treat you cheaply..."
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Wonderful ambiance one of the must go places in Hyderabad...., good food.... however reduced one star coz they have stopped their brewery and serving draught beer..."
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,"Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.

Ambience 5/5
Food 5/5
Service 5/5

Cost is resonable."
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,One of my favorites in terms of seafood variety and ambience. They have snagged the Goa charm pretty perfectly. We loved the prawn butter n garlic the best. Love to try their bebinka. Definitely recommend a revisit.
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"this place is really good n relaxing because of the ambiance.. loved the place, food was good.. it‚Äôs worth giving a try. live music is an add on to this"
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,Went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet. The place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either AC or outside. because of the heat we went inside. The starters and soup were served on the table. There were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome. Next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience.
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"Great place to have seafood in Hyderabad, Goan style. Beautiful ambience. Lovely live music. Must visit place for food lovers. Overall great experience. Will visit again. Service was quick and friendly."
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,Very bad
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"The Ambience of this place is amazing. As the place is usually away from the city there's a sense of calm. Wanted to try seafood in hyderabad and i guess this was the best place available.
The only complaint is they have buffet lune up till Friday so the options for weekends are usually limited."
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Been to this place couple of times but finally found time to share my review.
Great ambience with tasty food, more of the chicken was delicious and juicy.
One should also try the fries of this place.
Would recommend people to visit this place.
Best time to click photos at this place would be sunset time and want to hear good live music then the weekend is the best."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,"Beutifull indoor and outdoor sitting. Delicious food.we ordered man how chicken soup . ok
Loose prwans was good. crispy chilly pork so yummy .service is good"
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Bad for a Sunday lunch..the place might be good for evening ambiance but afternoon inside the closed..most ordinary rooms with no music.. just chatter of other guests is a mood spoiler. Extremely slow service. Food is tasty and that's the only reason one could visit the place.
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,All kind of food is good here wrt al a carte. Go for famous dishes here e.g. crispy chicken. Not a disappointment for experimenting either. Dish of the day was not up to the mark sometimes. Pricey for regular visits.
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Absolutely loved this place. Highly recommended.

Food: Delicious. Exotic. Hygienic. We tried lobster, prawns and red wine. We wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available. Maybe they should keep the menu items in stock. You may not get all the items listed. 10/10

Ambiance: Beautiful. Live music. Great lightening. For parties and a nice dinner. 8/10

Service: Satisfied. They prepare food just like you would like it, asking for instructions. Waiters were polite and nice. They served us cake as we went for birthday celebration. It was just a pastry but still nice gesture. 8/10"
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,The ambience tells everything. The place reminds of Goa. The must place for dinner. The food is tasty and they should try the Goan delicacies.
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Waste of money...
The worst place nd the waiter's was not cooperative..we have to call nd ask them to bring the starter...zero star..one of the worst experience ever had..üëé"
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"#6packfoodie goes The Fisherman's Wharf!

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

Peace‚úåüèª"
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Went here while I was on my trip to Hyderabad, the place is really huge.
Best things about this place: food, variety of drinks, dessert and fish.
Price Wise it's expensive, food quantity is great.
We're a bit late, but still they arranged proper food for us."
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,What a amazing place where I feel wow.

Service : amazing
Hygiene : 4
VFM : 4
Worth visiting once more: Yes"
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,Be wary when you visit in summer. Very hot and not ventilated properly. Average food. Alcohol content in drinks are below average. Ambiance is good
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"Away from the city, set up at a perfect location, beautifully lit, essence of Goa lingers all over.
Sea food lovers this is the place for you amidst all the hills in Hyderabad.
Tawa fry Fish is a must try.
Service is fantastic.
Music is mostly great.
Ambience is hands down a winner and good food along with a perfect mix of cocktails.
Goan style dishes would take your taste buds literally to Goa.
Special occasions like Diwali and Holi are also welcomed here like home.
Family or friends fits in good for both.
Finding a place in the weekend could be time taking so recommend to pre book a table."
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"If you love goa... This place is nostalgic... It has sectons divided with the names of places in goa like panjim, colva, baga etc

You don't need to give a second thought to the ambience at all... Its perfect for a date or a group...

Good place to have corporate party...

Friendly staff...

Food is awesome veg as well as nonveg...

Must try... Chilli paneer , nachos, fried rice , chilli chicken, prawn

All the alcohol they mention in the menu is available so not to worry for that... even the beers...

Cocktails to try... Mojito, cosmo, mai tai, sangria ... These are what i tried and they are best...."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Had been here a couple of times. Nice ambience, lots of place to sit. Courteous Staff Members Wil want you to visit this place again. The food is also nice. I think we indian restaurants should start asking spice requirements so that we don't end up getting spicy food."
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"I love sea food a lot and there are wide number of animals to eat üòÇüòÇ great ambiance, friendly staff. A non - vegetarian will enjoy this place for sure. Liquor prices are not goan prices üòÇ"
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Fisherman's Wharf is basically Goan themed restaurant with a huge seating area. They have outdoor seating facility as well as indoor seating arrangement. They also have buffet area, pub area, rooftop area etc. The ambience is beautiful. Now coming to the food, we ordered

I would recommend everyone to visit this place with your loved ones and spend some quality time here. I am pretty sure that you will not be disappointed."
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,Been to this place today for team lunch and this is my third visit. My experience from this Restaurant is that never opt for Buffet. Go for a la carte you will not regret.
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"Food :4
Service:4
Ambience:5

This is on the list for a long time and checked it off. Well it‚Äôs an Goan themed restaurant and they nailed the whole decor. Coming to food we went at 5:30 pm so not much of a choice in menu. So ordered fish fingers and chicken starter, both turned out good. Will definitely try again."
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"The place is open seating, gives a good airy feeling. Music is good and it had occupancy on a week day.

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!"
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"This has become my go to place now. We went on a Sunday evening, and really had a very good time with some delicious food and the band performing was also very nice. We ordered stuffed crab and I would say it is a must try dish. It was just mouth melting. In main course we had Goan prawn curry and rice and it was good. They also have fresh catch counter where you select and customize your sea food"
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"It has got just awesome ambience. Must visit place for sea food lovers. The live music adds to elegance to your moments. The food quality is amazing , the staffs are polite and kind."
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"Dun bombard the menu with so many things, great hospitality and tasty food is what makes a place happening. Not coming to this place ever again"
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"This is my third visit to the restaurant and surely im going again. It's a huge restaurant with very spacious seating...they have outdoor seating, indoor seating, bar area,buffet area, roof top area its pretty huge place..and every bit of the restaurant is amazing.. Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a mehüôÑ
Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.
I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!
Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..! I sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,This place has good ambiance but i had a weird experience with food. The menu drums of heaven mentioned chicken wings but we were served drumsticks instead. Upon enquiring the respective guy tried to convince us the drum sticks are drums of heaven. When we had to show him menu and explained the difference for crying out loud he said there is a mistake in menu and went. Next u guys be the judge.
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"We have visited the place for Thursday Dinner buffet and kindly do not try it. They have very limited options of starters and the choice of spread was really poor. Even the selection of alcohol was very basic.
Service could be much better in the buffet section as the drinks order need to be provided. Overall it's a total disappointment.
Food - 2/5
Service - 3/5

Kindly do not try the evening buffet as it's very bad."
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"I've been there with my girlfriend on a weekend, the ambiance was soulful. A bit expensive but the food was too good. The staff could be more professional and my girl enjoyed a lot i should say. Hitting the Gachibowli road for long ride? Do stop-by there...."
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Been to this place on Wednesday evening for family dinner . On a weekday also the place was crowded.
The place is very spacious and there is not much to talk about ambience . It‚Äôs pretty simple . Service is at its best .
Ordered : Veg machow soup , fisherman wharf special soup , butter garlic prawns , masala fried prawns , fried fish , badami broccoli, Goan prawn curry , chicken wings, egg fried rice , curd rice. All tasted decently good except egg fried rice.
Must try : Badami broccoli , butter garlic prawns , chef special soup . These tasted extremely delicious and special mention about curd rice üëå"
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"The ambiance and setup, basically the theme is just superb.
Very cordial staff and efficient too.

The highlight is of course, the food. Try the fried squid and butter garlic prawns. A bit expensive, but worth it.

Music is a little over the top, and unpleasant at times."
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Food wasn't up to the expectation. Friendly staff, the ambience was really good. Live music was very soothing. Would definitely visit again. Overall, thumbs up for replicating goa experience."

13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Situated at end of the city. Very Spacious and Ambience makes us feel like it was in Goa ! Theme restaurant like a fisherman's place ! Number of sea food items available! We can select a fish and make them prepare in customisation way ! We visited for a friend's party , ordered many items but we are not satisfied with the taste ! Soup tasted so bad ! Prawns and Fish items are not so much tasty ! Potato Starter was good ! Squats in fish was good ! Ordered Lemonade but not much great than I tasted before !"
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,Awesome food and ambiance as always...best place to spend weekend...pre-book your table to avoid waiting...zomato gold acceptance is good...
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,Should visit this place for dinner coz in summer you feel too much hot in afternoon that you can‚Äôt feel the taste of the food. Nice place for corporate team outing. Food was good and absolutely taste desserts first.
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,"Hi guys,

I went here as part of an office party. So can't really comment about the Al Carte.

The ambience is really cool. Full Marks to these guys for replicating Goa in such a great way.

The seafood variety is superb. All in all this place is good for people who eat sea food. The dj was also great. We had loads of fun."

13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"Excellent food,and Amazing service by Jamiruddin. Fishes are very fresh. One must try their prawns,lobsters, and bebinca. In short complete worth its price."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Been to this place 4 times, the best in Hyderabad for sea food and ambience, service, cost all worth it. 10/10 best of the best love it.

We have ordered tandoori pomfret which was very fresh and perfectly cooked, prawns excellently done not over cooked, drums of heaven and heavenly. Main course was absolutely mouth watering food was served hot, staff were very courteous. Anoop one of the staff was very helpful and kind.

Would recommend to families, friends, couples anyone who enjoys good food and ambience."
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"I Never knew i had such a great place near my home to chill out on weekends has really good beer, non veg starters, good ambience and quick service. And the best Sea food in Hyderabad üòçüòç"
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Very slow service, it took us more than 2.5 hours just to have dinner. Totally disappointed with respect to the amount of money they are charging."

13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"The best restaurant to chill out but food was surely not up to the mark .. chilly chicken too sweet : )
They say 2+2 drinks but when you order cocktails they say it won‚Äôt be applicable as they use 60 Ml
In that ... they should have told this before ordering :) Fish is too good .."
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"Every time I/we visit this place, it never fails to amaze with lipsmacking food. A 5+ service with 5+ food taste! Keep spreading love and warmth through your kitchen to our stomachs! üòç"
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"This place is a paradise for seafood lovers especially it gives you the look and feel of the west coast. The ambience is something you can get no where in Hyderabad. A Goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too. It is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money. The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers. Their service is very friendly. They do have valet and ample parking space. I have visited this place twice and I am so in love with the food and the ambience."
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"After so many recommendations we been there yesterday for couple of drinks...the ambience purely reflecting a typical Goan bar I can say it's simply unique place in the city where you can sit and enjoy fresh air along with Lite music , the staff where amazing I should thank specially Mr Dinesh ,Mr Rahul -thanks for the suggestion on food and drinks your recommendations satisfied our pallets and bellys hehehe..... the quality of food and drinks where awesome the service was very prompt thanks to Ashish,Zamir,Lalu and Naveen who looked after our table . Cheers guyz you people are rocking.

Dinesh and Rahul see you yaaa in next week ."

Ambience: 9/10
Service: 10/10

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you‚Äôre interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!"
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Good breezy sitting, great food, friendly staff... the place is a must try for all seafood lovers. The goa themed restaurant makes you miss goa the minute u enter the gate with a Goa 0kms milestone

Must try: cafreal chicken for starters, southern chicken.

Phata poster nikla hero: noodles and blueberry cooler

Parking: ample

Music: not too loud but entertaining and lively

Service: Super quick

Seating: Ample and comfortable

Served by: Mr. ashish

Dessert: try the goan delicacy bibinca (layered cake)



Visiting again: Definitely yes

Thanks Mr. Prajit and team!!"
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,"Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.
Fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment."
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Nice ambience and live band we have been visited with our family delicious food and nice cocktails had enjoyment time with nice sea food Verites we like fish starter with spices and Indian main course the service was nice by ashish, Komal and zamir..the cocktails taste good and boozy. We all are happily enjoyed with our family."
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"I had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night, while we were driving along the Financial District road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work. As we entered the place, I was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. The place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you Goa trips."
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,I went to this place with 7 friends. The ambience is really nice. The staff are polite n friendly. We had good time here. Food is really nice .
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"Surprisingly well versed ambience. The place is massive with a get-away-from-city feel. They serve wonderfully cooked seafoods(Goan focused). A tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I would recommend, to book table before hand; there are variety of sit outs to choose from. I would highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre a seafood lover."
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"visited with family wonderful ambiemce and live band nice food and service by ranvir ,teja, kiran and mukul friendly and smily thank you guys we will vist again sure ."
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"PERFECT FOR DATE NIGHTS!!!

Beautiful place, with great food and amazing cocktails. Especially there Raspberry LIIT's. Great options for both vegetarian and non vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu and I can assure you it will be great. The only set back is the service. Really slow, just place your order in one go."
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,Been the place for lunch and I loved the ambiance over there which resembles the same as Goa and the person who loves sea food will be attracted to this place ..
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,"I love the Ambience! Food is mouthwatering. If you think you don‚Äôt like coastal food, do go here. Trust me food will get you there each time if you crave for sea food. Crowd is nice. A peaceful place to be with friends or family. Do go there."
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,Sea food cravings. Close your eyes and reach this place in Hyderabad. A very wide spread variety of sea food. Can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied. Thats the fun of it. Ambience awesome . Staff too good. Feels homely. Love this restaurant more than anything. 5/5 for everything.
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,"A must visit for sea food lovers, brings in GOA to HYDERABAD. Would love to see more seating arrangements in the open area. Great food and lovely ambience. A must visit !! Don't miss out on the simple yet amazing fish curry rice."
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"Ambience is really good. Lot of space, laid back ambience, mist sprays - perfect for a lazy Sunday lunch! Coming to food, recommend trying only Goan cuisine. Didn‚Äôt feel the Buffet was special or so but their Ala Carte is real good. Sea Devil is a starter that stands out - prawns wrapped in Beacon, perfectly grilled. Butter Garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side. Goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice - Chicken Vindalho if you are looking for spicy or Chicken Xacuti if you want something less hot!"
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"Great ambience, great food! I would recommend the pan seared fish üëå
It's a little outside the city but the rooftop seating makes up for it."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Visited this place on Saturday evening.
Had stuffed crab , fish starter, chicken in goan style ( was very spicy),stuffed chicken.

In drinks we had bull frog, drink was strong and tasted good

We went to have sea food here, only one crab was available that is very big one .

Ambience is nice. I didn't liked the food much.
This place is very expensive also.

Overall not very happening place"
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"A place with great ambience and good food. Here you pay for the experience. Which is great and rear.
Would love to visit the place again soon."
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,I had ordered gobi methi paratha.. it was ok. Not good. It was too oily. Not much taste. It tasted like it was a re-heated paratha. Not fresh.
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,Food was good but it was all leaking from the plate. And so quantity was very less as compared and i expected rice as well with the thali but it was missing
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"Intially, yes,the food was really good they were maintaining quality standard of food very well,which is rare in Indian restaurant nowadays I don't see that happening these.Today I have found hair my fit thali,which shows how much hygienic they are ,apart from this so many times I have seen they miss on cutlery or few items. I mostly order fit thali so I know very well what it consist of not just one time so many time items are missing."
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"Hyderabad's most worst and ugliest biryani i had yesterday from the restaurant Eat fit and this worst restaurant people not allowing zomato people quick to the destination delivery points, it has been 2hr late i have received from the biryani from Eat fit, just disguised about the biryani of the EATFIT Alaasss.. this is a Horrible biryani i had ate in Hyderabad"
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,Very good at quality guys..even packaging is extraordinary..but chicken curry is not good which came more liquid with less taste.so quality quantity wise thumsup..but have to improve taste.
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,Thank you so much for the excellent food.it tasted great. Price quality everything good. I ordered via zomato online app. Delivery package was also great.if there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Order no - 1127326452

Ordered rajma rice and what I received cold and badly smelly rotten food. Completely disappointed.

And Zomato is not even helpful to resolve it."
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"Last time I ordered the food(Tofu keema wrap, dal makhni and parathe) from here, I was delivered spoiled food. The wrap was literally smelling sour and parathe were like they have been prepared in the morning and sent to us for dinner. I always order from this restaurant and since it was the first time, I wanted to ignore this But, still putting out this review so that management can introspect and figure out if this was process fault, delivery fault or a manual one."
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from. It offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from Indian, Continental, Oriental and even Caribbean. The food is prepared in a way that it is healthy, but doesn‚Äôt compromise on taste. Also, the dishes are reasonably priced. My only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,I had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome.. Healthy and tasty as well. Food quality was really very good. I had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review.. I couldn't help myself.. Fantastic.. Keep it upp.. U have raised a bar.. Do the good work always :)
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,I received food with a live green insect in it. What food standards are being followed! This is not expected from a restaurant with an ‚Äòexcellent hygiene‚Äô title!
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,Zomato please help me to give them negative rating to this restaurant. I fell sick after eating their roti. How awful it is. If your food not good your packaging will not give u business
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,Food was open
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,I ordered dal makhani with paratha . The parathas were good so soft and tasty .Dal makhani was ok.It was tasting some different but it was good .üòä
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Very delicious millet and chicken dish.
I feel so good ordering and eating from eat.fit bc I can see the nutritional value and no where else I have found this yet! I love that they give a mini free desert too - perfect sweet treat after a meal."
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"Till now ordered chef's special veg thali, oat meal, parantha in super breakfast
Pros
# Calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
# taste, quality are great

Now i felt few things can be improved
# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140. 
 I strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20% so that they can get more orders and new customers to"
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Great food. No oil, soft rotis, tasty gravy and juicy chicken. It's a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals."
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,We have multiple options to have food but thinking about healthier options - there are very few. I would like to appreciate all your effort to provide us an option to choose heathy and hygienic food. Great place to order healthy and tasty food.
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,very less quantity and food taste also not gud
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,"Ordered chef's veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome, 3 rotis, paneer curry( which had so many paneer) , salad, dal makhani, sweet, everything was equally good and tasty. Ordered for the first time from this place and with all the discounts I paid just 61 for the food and got 50 as cashback.
I totally loved it and would definitely order again
Quality-6/5 I did feel I am eating homemade, healthy food
Quantity-5/5
Value for money-6/5
Packaging- 5/5
Delivery- 6/5
It was a good experience ordering food from this place
PS this experience is when i ordered from cult app, later on when I order using Zomato things were quite different like delivery was late, no sweet"
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,Ordered lunch from this place. The taste was good. Food wasn‚Äôt spicy or oily. packing was good and quantity was sufficient. I would prefer to order again.
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? üòÉ

Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.

Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.

Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!"
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"they don't deliver your food. They charge for food but may deliver only half of the order. and when contacte Zomato tell you that Restaurant no. is switched off. Strange, are they in food delivery busines or this is something else? beware"
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,I ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for Zomato to deliver. Zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but I am never going to order from this restaurant. Also the food was below average. I ordered Tofu Keema roll.
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,Ordered a Wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset. The quality of food seemed really bad that time. Although I tried reaching out to Zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eat.fit team will get back. Till date I haven't received any response from either Zomato or Eat.fit
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,Hey Guys!! I ordered Chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasn't a good experience at all...The only plus point can be given for good packaging. But packaging doesn't count as we pay for good food. The biryani didn't even taste like a biryani. It was more like fried rice with chicken dumped. üò£ Had a very bad experience...
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,If you want to eat something delicious without feeling guilty about eating unhealthy food then eat.fit is your go to place. Delicious tofu keema parantha having no extra spice's and perfect balance of flavors
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat.fit which has 450Kcal (as mentioned).

Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. Chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad. A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. Not sure if I would order this again, but could maybe try their salads."
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"Why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry. Unless the buyers are fools.
Terrible pricing and quantity for the money.
2 stars just for decent taste of curry.
All those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can‚Äôt have sufficient food inside.
Oh boy, will never try üôèüèªüôèüèª

Btw, the dish name is chefs special nonveg thali üòÇ"
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,Forgot to give spoon and tissues
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,Worst food ..... I would never order from this again... I ordered lucknowi biryani .... That turned out bullshittt.... It looked like timato chutney rice ....
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"Eat healthy, eat.fit. Tried their nutty dates pudding and detox smoothie. Both were very good and it is good to have healthy food like these."
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"We ordered 1 Luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees. The taste was okay. Strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani. But I haven't had Lucknow biryani before, so can't really judge how it exactly supposed to taste."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Delivery boy was reluctant to the deliver the order and was unable to navigate the maps. He reached to different location and when I was trying to navigate him he said he don‚Äôt know the address which was mentioned
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"Dal tadka awesome rajma chawal so-so, too garlicky"
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Food arrived wonderfully packed.  I ordered an omelette for breakfast and in the tray were also some beans, small portions of bread, potato wedges and roasted tomatoes.  A very pleasant eating experience - though the omelette and sides were slightly cold upon arrival.  I might add - for 160 rupees including delivery - the meal was an exceptional value."
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"Ordered the breakfast combo from zomato. The taste was good and simple. Feels just like home made food and healthy too. The breakfast combo had a bread/bun, omelette, grilled tomato and side(curry kinda ) for the bun."
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,I ordered from this place from Zomato. The amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant. I ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes. The juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml. The potato flakes nothing more than normal Haldiram mixture. I am definitely not ordering next time.
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è

Well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.

So i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their Chicken Keem Paratha Wrap. Its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. It tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus.

Yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. But yes, a nice concept though!"
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Great, hygienic and health food. Good packing.
All the ingredients look and taste fresh. More importantly, you get what you see.
I hope they maintain the veg non veg segregation.
A little expensive."
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,"Food quality and quantity is not up to mark. A family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 RS and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less. No raita or salan given. Not at all worth for money.
Quality is also not very good, didn't feel anything great about , worst place to order food. Sorry however that's the reality.. Thanks."
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"I found a small wooden stick in the tofu keema wrap I ordered from eat.fit. Apparently, not so hygenic and healthy as they claim themselves to be!"
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,"An easy choice everyday among so many others for dinner. Not only is the food tasty, hygienic and healthy, their services, discounts and the entire cure fit package is just amazing and a well deserved hype success"
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,I had ordered veg pulav and egg masala bowl no egg and no taste pulav have no vegetables even restaurant took 1 hour to give it to the delivery boy this is ridiculous ü§¨ü§¨
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"Ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again it's very delicious. I see that this time different type of oats(wheat based) are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher. Like the combination of oats, sabza seeds and milk & the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear, cranberries besides apple, dates, pomegranate."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Have ordered from here multiple times but today the food wasn't up to standards. Ordered 'Chef's Special Combo for 2'. The salad and raita smelled bad. Weren't fresh. Had to throw them away. You folks have made a name, stick to its standards."
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"Had ordered veg pulao & rajma, it didn't seem fresh .. however I consumed it & couldn't sleep whole night because of vommiting & loose motion.
Will never order food from eat.fit again."
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Super delicious nutty dates pudding. Simple dish made with wheat, milk, natural sweetener jaggery(gud). It was topped with almonds, dates, kishmish. There was no cashew nuts as specified in menu. Else would've rated 5.
Pomegranate protect was simply amazing. One can feel raw pomegranate, coconut juice. Satisfied with quantity for both items(bought on zomato offer)"
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,"Fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing. Surprisingly it's not what typical oatmeal bowls are. Oats, soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear, apple, pomegranate, dates and mint leaves. Superb taste enough for a person.
All eatfit drinks/juices are amazing and so was Guava glow. Could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon. The pepper was unidentifiable in juice."
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,Less quantity
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"Really healthy and tasty food. Quantity is a bit at the lower end for the given price, hence expensive.

Would recommend dal chawal. The sweet they as complimentary are really good. Should try to reduce plastic use in packaging as they are heavy on it due to marketing stunts"
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,quantity too less for a meal
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"Ordered chicken thali for two from here. Loved the effort they put in packaging and attaching printed labels of your name to the food.
A wholesome meal for two, it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each, daal, chicken gravy, raita, salad, pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar.
A healthy alternative to oustide food if you're working out . Enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well."
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,not valued for money
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"I strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories. I would suggest eat.fit to look after the quantity,because I think it's very little with this price tag. Apart from this everything is extraordinary like packing ,presentation,quality etc...All the best eat.fit."
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"I have ordered kachori & chana chaat for home delivery from zomato. I was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eat.fit ( previously ordered food quality being good). As soon as I opened the box bad smell was coming, then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori's. The chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori's were also smelling bad. I had to throw away everything. I don't think I can order again with trust on their food quality."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,"Dates tea cake was good. I was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates. It was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier.
Topped with chia seeds, the Lemon tea cake was surprising as I could feel cinnamon. It was slightly oily. At first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake.
These cakes are Wheat based just as described which is a good thing.Though the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes, I wish it could've been more just as shown in cult fit website."
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Health consciously designed menu and quality food. Packing is also very nice.
Keep up the good work.  Provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner."
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"Eat.fit is is the next level service witch can offer you the basic and simple food with all required proteins, calories and energy. And their packing is awesome üëè"
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"Totally love the food. The food tastes great, isn't fried, oily or too spicy. Just the way I like it. Has helped me check my weight also. Thank you. What would I have done for my everyday lunch without you? ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,I ordered tofu keema paratha and it was really good with the right measurable quantity of healthy and delicious food. The food was perfectly packed.
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,The taste was OK and food seems healthy. For the prices that we have the quantity is way less. Doesn't fill half your stomach. Overpriced. Worthless!!!
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,chicken was good..mix veg is very sweet..and small roties..
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"eat.fit you beauty üòç

If there's one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong, it has to be eat.fit outlets.

I have ordered tofu burji and lacha paratha for breakfast this morning. There was also yummy tomato chutney apart from burji.

If you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free, tasty and with great packing it has to be this place.

eat.fit provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I never, ever, ever knew healthy food can be so tasty.

Order now!!!!!"
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,Ordered this delicious healthy dish! ‚ù§ massaman veg curry and thai rice bowl... Loved it. Curry is so smooth and contains everything as described in the eat.fit. menu.
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Everybody is talking about Eat Fit these days! I was curious to know what's causing so much buzz? So, I ordered Chef's Special Veg Thali.It contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!

I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.

But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.

Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.

It's great to see that people are so health conscious now. Eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution. Hope they keep inspiring us :)"
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,very poor food and my items were missing
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,I had ordered chilly chicken Hakka noodles. It taste good. Chicken pieces are well seasoned and juicy. Iam impressed with the presentation. Taste would have much better. It not taste like real Chinese cuisine. But I recommend to try atleast once
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"Healthy food calls for eat.fit.. good packing and decent food.. price is a bit on the higher side
Rotis could have been better. Will definitely order more from here.."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"AVOID. This place is a scam. If there is even a place: I cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address. Anyway, I ordered a healthy chicken breast dish. They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food."
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"Can you explain, how spicy food is healthy? In addition to this, the chapatis were super dry and both vegetables were tasteless. Not worth the wait and money of course."
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,The food was amazingly delicious. I ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive. they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious. the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious.
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,"I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 

1) They do not use any processed ingredients 
2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )
and there are various other reasons as well 

The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.

The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed 

Verdict 
Taste 4.5/5
Packaging 4/5
VFM 4.5/5
Overall 4.5/5
Zomato Delivery - 1/5"
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"Frankly speaking this is my 5th order and many more to come.
Hygeine-5/5
Taste-5/5
Quality-5/5
Very impressed with the out of box concept of a superfood served with all items. Keep it up!!"
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,Overpriced crap on the name of healthy food. The food industry has become a dark business nowadays looting customers on the name of healthy food. Quantity is too less at the price they sell.
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"I have been wanting to have food from this place since a while as it had a good rating and reviews as well and the main thing here is ""healthy food"" unlike the other restaurants were we wouldn't even know how many calories we are consuming and I was thrilled to order food from this place. So I ordered Vegetable Pulao (BrownRice) and egg white masala curry and let me tell you it tasted yum and the packing was excellent. Damn I guess I'm gonna be quite regular in ordering food from here now!!"
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"Excellent food. Everytime I order Just love the way they present their food and the freshness nd nutrition it has. Perfect food place for fitness freaksss. Keep up the same honest work you give!!
Kudos!!"
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"You need to improve your packing. Had ordered veg Thai green curry with rice. By the time it was delivered to me, curry had splashed all over the container , even leaking from package. Zomato delivery person said it leaked while getting it. Had second thoughts abt whether to consume it or not."
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"It‚Äôs really difficult to get tasty healthy food. Eat.fit is kinda solving this problem. Food quantity is good, display of nutritional facts made me happy. I know what I am eating and can plan my day if following a diet.

Ordered Chicken Peanut Curry & Wok-Tossed Millet Bowl. Gravy tasted good with mix of veggies. Quality of chicken in the gravy is less than normal portion. Millers were kinda dry,overall good experience for me."
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,Great place to order decent food. Have ordered dinner from them on multiple occasions. The taste is definitely great - especially their exotic chicken dishes. The indian menu is also very satisfying. Have developed a deep liking for their date pudding. It's great comfort food. The food is not oily and doesn't leave you feeling bloated.
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,"The berry blast smoothie tasted very good. Could actually feel the taste of papaya, watermelon, blueberries,etc and can even make them out. The quantity was a big disapointment. The bottle was thin as well. The smoothie was finished in few gulps."
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Taste is not good and also not freshly prepared. It seems food was cooked at afternoon and delivered during evening for dinner. Also not spicy.
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"Highly recommend this place. The entire menu is so captivating and pleasing at the same time with a thought left in your mind that ""yay don't worry you are eating healthy"". And the food literally looks healthy no excess oil no hints of butter etc it's simply delicious and perfect. I tried Dal Makhni, Paneer Curry, Masala Chaach and Tofu Keema Wrap all were fantastic in order of my mention .ü§ü"
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"I ordered Thai chicken rice. First of all, it is on the expensive side. Second, the quantity wasn't good, third it was spicy. Seems like they are spending more on fancy packaging than the actual food."
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,not tasty
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,I've ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl and it was delicious and it contains green apple and basil seeds and pomogranate and banana and also dates .its the most healthiest diet that one could ever have in an affordable price.it tastes delicious and oats taste good .if you're on diet and want to choose a perfect oat meal this is the best one that you've ever asked for .keep it up guys .
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,I have ordered for one item oat meal and received another item ghar rasma veg pulao. Which is not satisfactory and wastage of food and money.
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,It said thali but not adequate quantity
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,"An awsumm place where u can order variety of healthy food .Strongly recommended to try everything on the menu as it is healthy, fresh and hygienic everytime its ordered. U dont have to worry about the calories.Every dish comes properly labelled with it's nutritional value, so you know what you're having."
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Ordered the paneer-dal combo for 2 people. It comes well packed in a big box. The quantity of the food is great! 3 chapatis for a person, raita, dal makhni, paneer, salad, pickle and super food supplement. We also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake. So in terms of quantity a 5/5. Coming to the taste - The paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty. Dal was decent, probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind, wasnt high on spices or oil. The curd was fresh and good in taste as well! Loved the over all parcel!"
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,"Dear eat.fit , what on Earth charging you 180/- ? For this 3 rotis, 2 spoons of veg curry, enough dal and little salad with spoon of raita
I am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness.

3 star is for taste and quality. But quantity doesn't even meet expectations.
Very poor"
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"I ordered from eat.fit and sorry to say the food was at all not good. Both taste and quantity were below my expectations.
The food I ordered was Masala egg curry with Vegetable Pulao with Order Id: 1676056120

Zomato delivery guy when delivered I realized that curry was spilling from the box. When enquired he said this is packaging problem.
After Zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eat.fit seems to be not bothered. 
After opening the box the food was just half a bowl. Rice taste seems to be of very low quality. Bad service from eat.it and from Zomato.

My first and last order from eat.fit. Already uninstalled Zomato . Overall very unpleasant experience."
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,Quality of food and packing is good.. Quantity is less in the bowl.. My advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity won't be sufficient for an individual.
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Great food came up with neatly packed and the delivery person was handled the package with care and delivered on time, thanks to Zomato to be a partner with this kind of great restaurant around us. Eat.fit is unbelievable and marvellous food making and packing"
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"This restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web page
And after a long hard work I found one contact through zomato customer service .....which was also WRONG
This shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurant
They have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact number
Moreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from them

Poor show

I would give a half star

Horrible experience with eat.fit"
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Ambience:NA
Service: NA
Food: very tasty and healthy. Dry fruit laddu is best part of athletic meal.
Matar patti with tomato curry is very tasty, soft, rich flavour of tomatoes enhanced the tast even more.

Dal makhani with parata
Food &quality: 3/5
Dal makhani is chatpat no other flavour. Parata were pure wheat made but they were hard when I received. Sweet was not good at all but mix of sounf, sesame....
Overall it was ok.

Dal Makhani with tawa roti
Packaging: Very good as always
This time I received hot roti and tasty dal makhani.
Small sweet box have peanut chikki.
Overall it's a good place to order food."
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,"I had lachha paratha and chettinad chkn. Lachha paratha was cold and was very hard to chew. For the amount you guys are charging, I expected a better experience."
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"Eat fit - name itself suggest healthy food..
I have ordered it from Zomato and the delivery was quick..
I ordered veg paneer keema paratha and lucknowi biryani.. Packaging was good and food was hot..
paratha was delicious it was flooded with lots of paneer and finely chopped veggies..it's healthy and tasty too..

Loved their lucknowi biryani too.. veggies were coated with delicious spices..and that aroma was Soo good..They served raita and salan which was tasty too..

Follow me on Instagram on veganyums_ for more food fun and pics.."
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,"Eat. Fit surprised me the way they packed the food is really nice. Nice parota with good curry, I recommend order from eat.fit is worthfull....."
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"The biryani here is very delicious, one should must have this biryani if they visit Hyderabad. You will compare all but this tops the chart in satisfaction... üòã"
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,I have ordered khabooz Normal which is with salad.I liked the portion size very much I have never seen that much portion size in any other shawarma outlet.It was very much for me the taste was also good.Would like to try their other shawarma's.
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Was surprised to know that SG runs a Shawarma hub too. All thanks to SG biryani's which made me order Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it. The delivery, packaging, taste and quantity was perfect. Trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy. It came without vegetables, and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end, it is always best to have little extra mayo!"
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"I ordered their Special Chicken Shawarma from Zomato. First look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. The quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.It is not at all good. The chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. It usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.The quality needs to improve a lot.
Stay healthy. Keep eating..not from here.
Cheers"
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,Super taste and packing was nice. This is one of my favourite food. And we had with friends everyone gave same rating. we enjoyed a lot. Thanks Zomato
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,I bought food from them twice. Rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma. Both were good and tasty. I liked the Libby shawarma more and the Rumali was also good but Libby better. The Rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern I had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. I should have given instructions. The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. Totally; I am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"Delivery Review :

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,Shawarama from this place is like heaven . No doubt we enjoy every bite from it . Try dry fruit chicken shawarama for sure . Thanks Zomato and Shah house for such mouthwatering dishes
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,While I am eating my food I get this in my food the steel wire it cut my tongue inside. The worst experience while having my food i am suggesting don't buy shawarma from shah ghouse
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,Delicious and timely delivery! Dont miss the roomali shawarmas! Im on a business trip to hyderabad and this shawarma kept me company while I worked into the night.
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"If you want Mouthwatering bites then this for you guys. Hyderabad's one of the best Shawarma.

13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"Had tried Chicken Shawarma, Lukmi, Samosa, Veg Puff, Egg and Chicken Puff.
Chicken Shawarma, was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok. It tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark. Overall Didn't meet my expectations.

Both Lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation, just the shape was different. Better to go for samosa instead of Lukmi, the taste was ok though.

Comming to the Puffs, all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery. Not a big fan of these."
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Some pieces of chicken are totally uncooked (raw) and important thing, I had ordered for two shawarmas and I got only one, I don't know what went and whose fault it is....
One who delivered, he was saying that you had ordered only one... When I spoke with the person of hotel who answered my call, said that it may be delivery boys fault,
Seems that no value for customer queries..."
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,Not very pleasant experience with Shawarmas here. Was very tasty but got hard time digesting. Unpleasant burps until took medicine. And it was not only me but my friend also experienced same.
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"As in the name, the shawarma is truly special. And it's more than the money it costs. Tastes heaven. Delivery is quick as well.
So it's the right thing to order if you want some tasty chicken to kill your hunger"
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,I tried 5 highest rating Shawarma places in Hyderabad and this is the best + most filling place. Simply amazing. The special rumali is the best.
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"I ordered a chicken rumali shawarma just now from this place and added instructions in my order NOT to put that slimy, greasy ""mayonnaise"" some of these places are famous for. Lo and behold : opening the food parcel was the item with the awful slimy, sickening mayo I had requested not to be added!  And I might add - there was only meat and mayo - no vegetables such as included in shawarma ordered from better places (this was listed as ""special shawarma"")."
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"The Dry Fruit Shawarma is awesome and every time I've ordered two for my self and I've finished as well, The only hotel I love in entire Hyderabad is Shah Ghouse."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"One of the best places where one can visit to taste Shawarmas and can get easily addicted. Just in love with your Chicken Malai Special, hands down. üíØ"
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,"Best shawarma near gachibowli... Affordable and worth every penny. Delivery valet was also very customer friendly
Really enjoyed every biteüòãüòãüòã"
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,I must say i did not expect much after trying a few so called famous shwarma shops in Hyderabad. But I think this one equalled if not bettered istah shawarma house. The chicken pieces were cooked amazingly well. Loved the cream. Packaging could have been better.
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,The shawarma roll had uncooked meat! I got pieces of bones too! I'm very much disappointed with Shah Ghouse spl Shawarma! The quantity may be sufficient enough but quality matters more. If uncooked...it is good for nothing.
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,excellent to taste
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,Late delivery almost after 30 mins
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,It was not the same like before. There were big big pieces of chicken instead of cutting them into smaller pieces.
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,good for late night cravings
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Authentic biriyani. Must try the platters. Its an old and good brand. The service is not up to the mark given their confidence that people will come no matter how they treat customers. The food will cool you down even if their behavior is not good. Overall, okay experience."
13-06-2025,01:25:10,No,"Ordered special rumali chicken shawarma, was delivered uncooked chicken with a soggy rumali roti! Not worth the name!! Never ever gonna order!!"
13-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Very spicy shawarma, not for people like who don‚Äôt eat spicy. Based on rating went to try but it was very spicy couldn‚Äôt finish it and ended up having upset stomach."
13-06-2025,03:25:10,No,Delicious shawarmas I tasted over here. So try here once in life time . Especially I like samoli and khaliooz. Rumali is not so good. Nice nice
13-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Never seen any place that is so unhygienic and dirty. Place is so dirty I have no words. Never seen anything like this. Not sure how people order and eat here.
13-06-2025,05:25:10,No,Yesterday i ordered dry fruit shawarma from this restaurant nd it disturbed my stomach so much. At olden days it was so good but now they are giving worst Shawarma.. I instructed to add extra mayonnaise but there is no minimum mayonnaise also.. Chicken is so hard to eat cant eat it..i informed about this to zomato they are not responding nd either restaurant not responding ..dont try Shawarma here nd ruin ur health
13-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"One of my chauffeur in Hyderabad recommended this place for authentic Persian food. And I was disappointed. This place didn't live upto the fame and name. The meat wasnt well cooked. The taste was bland. The service was fast, however the quality of service was a disappointment. A cold finger bowl at the end made it worst. Ambiance 0/5, service 2.5/5, staff 3.5/5, food 1/5, value for money 1.5/5."
13-06-2025,07:25:10,No,"This place promises to be one of the good Shawarma outlets in Gachibowli. Drive down there for Shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles. So sit back and order online. My order contained 1 Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma and I have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more. Filled with Hummus and the chicken was just cooked right. It is surely at par with the Shawarma served at Shahi Dastarkhwan, Lakdi Ka Pul. The search for a still better Shawarma continues. My 5 Star rating is still pending for the best Shawarma."
13-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,I did not expect like this from shahghouse ..1st time sharwarma with bun..and it is SPL ...And on the cover it S G is shahghouse or another doing on your name in online...please check and do better..
13-06-2025,09:25:10,No,For the first time when I has shawarma here it was great and thought of ordering it again... but the issue with these kind of places is that they just serve good food until they are famous and once done the quality descends drastically... the best shawarma I had is at SK Shawarma DLF and other opposite to food bazar nizampet...
13-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,Chicken taste is not good
13-06-2025,11:25:10,No,Was a great having one of the best shawarma...Everything was just as perfect as it could have been...and specially try the the one shawarma with that Malai one...that is the yummiest
13-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,i ordered chicken shawarma it‚Äôs a worst experience the chicken gets spoiled and smells we threw it away. very worst experience stay away from this restaurant.
13-06-2025,13:25:10,No,Not a great one and not a bad one either. Can try it once. The packaging isnt great and it spill off easily. Give a try but dont expect too much.
13-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"One of the besstt places to order shawarma. This is a Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma. The chicken is so tender and juicy, the spicy shawarma with mayo/malai hits right on your taste buds. The quantity is filling and overwhelming. I love this place and I do recommend this place to all my non veg lover friends. Great quality & quantity of food. Keep it up! ü§ò Wish I could give more than 5 stars!"
13-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"I ordered chicken shawarma from here suaces got leaked completely as you can see in pics packing was bad.zomato delivery was so late I don't it is mistake of Shah ghouse or Zomato delivery executive I thrower that shawarma bcz of it
Generally we get best shawarmas here but I had very bad experience of packing and delivery executive."
13-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,Excellent taste no replacement for shahghouse shawarma .Quantity is worth .No delay in delivery with unique taste .Try once and without any doubt you will addict
13-06-2025,17:25:10,No,delivered on time
13-06-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Ordered Malai Shawarma, it was very tasty and mainly not spicy, but when ordered for 2nd time it was very spicy!! But overall it's good and one of the best places to taste Shawarma in Hyderabad."
13-06-2025,19:25:10,No,"This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!"
13-06-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"This place serves the best shawarma at the most reasonable cost. Everyone should try shawarma at this place. The shawarma is totally stuffed with chicken,the fattest shawarma i ever had."
13-06-2025,21:25:10,No,very poor food
13-06-2025,22:25:10,Yes,very bad packing n item.....the restuarant rating 4.1 and the food was not matching....its so DISAPPOINTED.......!
13-06-2025,23:25:10,No,"Although Shah G is famous for its late night dine in facility, the Shawarma is pretty awesome too. A Shawarma with a single Irani chai in the evening is so Hyderabadi"
13-06-2025,00:25:10,Yes,badWe are ordered at around 5pm but that's delivered by 7:15pm
14-06-2025,01:25:10,No,Over sausage in the shawrma roll
15-06-2025,02:25:10,Yes,I believe the food was spoilt because of which we fell ill that night.
16-06-2025,03:25:10,No,Didn't like the quality. Seems like it's been stored
17-06-2025,04:25:10,Yes,"One of the best shawarma joints in Hyderabad.
The quantity is enough to satisfy one's craving for shawarma. Chicken is tender and juicy and mayonnaise does its work like a charm with the chicken.Must try Special rumali shawarma.If you are a North Indian and love shawarma then this the place for you. Chicken lollipop is also one of their specialities."
18-06-2025,05:25:10,No,"Been to this place plenty of times.
Ordered special rumali and khubus.
Falafel is also good
Very busy and
should wait for sometime for the order.
Parking is hectic.

Overall worth a try"
19-06-2025,06:25:10,Yes,good service
20-06-2025,07:25:10,No,Just make lil spicy
21-06-2025,08:25:10,Yes,so tasty and jucey and yummy
22-06-2025,09:25:10,No,"I ordered a Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma from this restaurant.
The chicken was quite spicy but the taste is good.
Everyone can try it once.

The delivery was on time."
23-06-2025,10:25:10,Yes,Reduced the quantity from before. I hope they get back to the old times
24-06-2025,11:25:10,No,"Shawarma at Shah ghouse is very tasty...
I love to order it from Shah ghouse only..
Quantity of a shawarma at Shah ghouse makes your stomach happyü§ó..."
25-06-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!"
26-06-2025,13:25:10,No,if u look at the they make it u wont even try it. but once u try it u wont forget it. its aswum. place is dirty and lack cleanliness and hygiene. but taste is really gud and pocket friendly too
27-06-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"Shawarma here is the best. It tastes different from every other shawarma joint. The way the chicken taste is just amazing. Don't know about biryani, but if you are looking for an amazing shawarma experience, you must try this."
28-06-2025,15:25:10,No,"A very popular shop nearby the hotel I was staying in Gachibowli. Just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big Shah Ghouse complex housing the restaurant, pan shop, tea shop and this Shawarma joint. 

Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before.
 
This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack."
29-06-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Best shawarma place in Hyderabad, quality and taste is too good. Eat to have best shawarma in Hyderabad, go to Shah house. Very rush during night time"
30-06-2025,17:25:10,No,The best shawarma you can have is here. The quantity and the quantity both are awesome. One shawarma is enough in terms of dinner or lunch. I always prefer to have from this place
01-07-2025,18:25:10,Yes,food is good
02-07-2025,19:25:10,No,worst taste i ever had
03-07-2025,20:25:10,Yes,Ordered Special Chicken Shawarma Rumali and Special Chicken Shawarma Samoli. The taste is amazing and the quantity is also good and sufficient for one person. The online order facility is only available through Zomato. Giving Minus -1 for oil and the amount of spice as the Shawarma is Oily and Spicy but it's taste awesome. Feedback for this great place would be to make it a little bit less spicy.
04-07-2025,21:25:10,No,goid service
05-07-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"Waah! kya shawarma man!

Really succulent chicken, sweet, flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti. This is a full-sized dinner-replacement wrap that's bang-on with the flavours. The only shawarma in the twin-cities worth craving for. Do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life, let it be this and thank me later.
P.S. The chicken is on the spicier side though."
06-07-2025,23:25:10,No,"Rating 3.5/5
Although very little resemblance with the Lebanese shawarma wrap, the Rumali roti shawarma tasted good. The wrap has good quantity of chicken stuffings and the sauce was good too. But once again, the chicken was quite spicy. So if you are looking for healthy food, this shawarma isn't your call. Very fast delivery."
07-07-2025,00:25:10,Yes,shawarma is not tasty. need to improve in taste
08-07-2025,01:25:10,No,wrong item received
09-07-2025,02:25:10,Yes,Shawarma was really good and full of chicken but but but chicken was too much roasted and there was lack of mayonnaise which should be increase to make it feel like juicy...
10-07-2025,03:25:10,No,good taste
11-07-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Shawarma is not like shawarma. It's like rumali roti filled with chicken khorma or sweet roti filled with leftover chicken curry nd some mayo in a corner that you might have to search.
12-07-2025,05:25:10,No,quick delivery
13-07-2025,06:25:10,Yes,late delivery
14-07-2025,07:25:10,No,Awesome... before the time delivery.. satisfied.
15-07-2025,08:25:10,Yes,I got match stick inside shawarma
16-07-2025,09:25:10,No,The best shawarma to have when in town! I had a rumali malai chicken shawarma which was just right amount of spicy and well flavoured. Filling for a dinner
17-07-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"ordered Khaliooz and samoli shawarma, everytime the quantity used to be good now the meat was very less in quantity and quality doesn't meet standards."
18-07-2025,11:25:10,No,Great
19-07-2025,12:25:10,Yes,good
20-07-2025,13:25:10,No,excellent delivery
21-07-2025,14:25:10,Yes,Nice
22-07-2025,15:25:10,No,Chicken in the shawarma is stale and stinking... Went to the place and was very unhygienic. Won't ever order anything from here. Shah ghouse quality is pathetic.
23-07-2025,16:25:10,Yes,You ppl always miss the curd and raita and lemons on Biriyani order form this application please provide all the things along with food. If you don't change this ppl definitely look your collapsing in soon.
24-07-2025,17:25:10,No,"Chicken shawarma is awesome.. but ordered veg falafel too, with instructions not to put cucumber(kheera) because I am allergic to cucumber.. but have ignored it n made me fall sick... Also,I mentioned extra mayoneese which wasn't there!

01-08-2025,01:25:10,No,Chicken inside the Shawarma got spoiled and smelling too.. Once opened it and was smelling spoiled.. Before ordering only I thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time... But due to the trust on shah Ghouse ordered it.. And initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it.. I last order I thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday I ordered shawarma and he repeated the same.. Food quality In shah Ghouse getting bad day by day
02-08-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Man this place. Hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill, eat and drink.
The food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite part.
We tried almost everything on the menu (perks of zomato gold) and nothing really was a disappointment.
The place looks amazing and has a cost feel. They have a setup on the balcony from where the view is just amazing."
03-08-2025,03:25:10,No,Best place to be to hangout with your loved ones üëåüôåüèª ambience and taste of food... one no need to comprise on that.. friendly staff.. staff sandip very humble and understands your taste.. worth being there... good value for money

05-08-2025,05:25:10,No,"My peace of advice pls don't waste your money. Over pricy, but buffet spread has very less items. Very much disappointed and the food was not even hot"
06-08-2025,06:25:10,Yes,Had visited for lunch buffet.to my surprise at 2 pm most of the dishes were hardly left and were not replenised.also service is slow had to wait even to pay bill inspite of the fact that it was half occupied.had much more expectations for that price range.definitly not value for money.
07-08-2025,07:25:10,No,Food was not that great just ambience was good very very conjusted sofa area worst ac service was good but I dnt recommend this place for food
08-08-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Been here for my college farewell on a tuesday afternoon! Absolutely loved the ambience. In Food , starters were amazing . However, main course and desserts could be better. We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,

Will recommend for partys with friends!!"
09-08-2025,09:25:10,No,"Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.
 Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area."
10-08-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Visited this place while IPL screening. They were running couple of bucket offers on drinks and food. Ambiance is nice and you get the botanical garden view free of cost. music is too loud for me. we ordered one Pizza and a chicken starter both were good.
Ambiance: 5/5
Music: 3/5
Food: 4.5/5

11-08-2025,11:25:10,No,Good taste of food and nice ambience.staff are really friendly@sandip.music was really good and atmosphere was energetic.its good place to njoy with friends and family
12-08-2025,12:25:10,Yes,Pathetic restuarant. I had to struggle even for getting a table. Once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle. They messed up with everything. I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience. I wasted my money time and energy.
13-08-2025,13:25:10,No,Visited this place on Friday first of all I would like to compliment DJ zain sabri for playing whatever song I‚Äôve requested and the food was good the ambiance was perfect for me and my friends we‚Äôll surely come back.
14-08-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"Very fast deliveries , quality and taste were very good be it veg/nonveg. Njoyed the big screen, music, dance floor, drinks, food, ambience..!!It was a ladies night on most of the fridays which makes the pub more lively as well.

19-08-2025,19:25:10,No,"# DJ Hardcore Saturdays
# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."
20-08-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"Very nice and cozy place with good ambience. Food was also great. Staff was also courterous, we were served by Sandeep who happened to be a really polite and gentle person. Overall I would highly recommend the place."

24-08-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.

Also the live music there wasn't great."

26-08-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"All services delayed, menu changes, very limited options in snack and food when asked they say it‚Äôs menu from Delhi and can‚Äôt help. Inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table. Asked for French fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in. Ok last one came finally when THE MANAGER arrived after being aggressive. They want to offer free drinks but it‚Äôs not about money but experience, will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back."
27-08-2025,03:25:10,No,"This was my second visit to the place and I am very disappointed for the following reasons:

1) The first time I visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue

I dicided to give it another shot and came again.

2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.

PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ. You need feel the pulse of audience."

02-09-2025,09:25:10,No,"Pathetic experience I have had in recent times. Arrived for buffet at 2pm I. Saturday afternoon. The food was cold as ice, no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers.

The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.

Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.

Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.

Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.

Really disappointed"

07-09-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance."
08-09-2025,15:25:10,No,They have worst north indian food i believe. Spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food. But other than that chinese and continental was good. Their safe sex on beach deink is great just.
09-09-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇ

I ordered for üçÖüç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. The üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.

It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts."
10-09-2025,17:25:10,No,Amazing place and best to chill out with friends.Specially the outdoor ambience we simply loved it as well as the food was also nice and along with the service

13-09-2025,20:25:10,Yes,As here the food was good and they serve all the cusines chinese north and hyderabadi and buffet the chinese dishes were delicious compared to others can go with friends for hangout
14-09-2025,21:25:10,No,"Went on a Saturday night. It was ladies night. I enjoyed the feel ambience, music and dance floor. I wish there could be a better system for ladies night rather than queuing up across bar counter n shouting to be Heard amongst over enthusiastic young ladies pushing you around.
Feel was just right n Music was bomb.. danced till we drop"
15-09-2025,22:25:10,Yes,Pizza is good...nice staff...ambiance good but better to visit night time to see the beauty of lights...place is very quiet during day time.

Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 1/5

I visited the place last week. The food was tasty and so was ambience but I have serious concern with the services.

We asked for regular water , and they brought dirty, stinky water just to sell the bottled water. The waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free.

It was highly irresponsible.
Also we had to literally beg them to bring the cheque.

Please train your staff if you want to ."
18-09-2025,01:25:10,No,"Nice place for hangout.............. and sevice was too great, n server nitish is treat like as friend.....
And his suggestions is very amazing ..... So plz meet him before service.........."
19-09-2025,02:25:10,Yes,Amazing place to chill. Live music and ambience is up to the mark. Food is fine. They should include some options in mocktails and drinks. Overall a good place to hangout with friends.
20-09-2025,03:25:10,No,One place to order pasta when you‚Äôre hungry in office also stomach filling with two toasted breads if your hungry want to order something quickly without scrolling down much just order it and wiat for the food
21-09-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Menu needs a major overhaul. Not for a large group of people. Not for everyone due to limited items in menu. Mocktails are damn expensive. Ambience not as good as few competitors.
22-09-2025,05:25:10,No,The place is within the SLN mall in gachiwali.we took the inside seating.the ambience is petty coll.we had couple of beer & long island ice tea with chi 65 which is yamiüëç
23-09-2025,06:25:10,Yes,"There is a cafe named Hyper Local Cafe in Manikonda ,I don‚Äôt know if this belongs to the same one but went to this place with certain expectations but was disappointed...it has quite a good experience,especially outside there is a nice setup ,leaving that apart ,food was not upto the mark ,Had Butter Naan and two chicken curries which really didn‚Äôt make me happy..they can improvise and can work on the taste

28-09-2025,11:25:10,No,"I had the worst experience here on April 5th, 2019. I came here with my friends. They first served cold non veg platter. However, the worst came in when we ordered Momo's. The container had three cockroaches running around. We returned it immediately. The music was pathetic as well. We left the place as soon as we could."
29-09-2025,12:25:10,Yes,We liked the chhole bhature as it was not at all oily. They serve good Italian dishes as well. Pizza crust is baked well. Service can be improved.
30-09-2025,13:25:10,No,"Bartenders are very courteous and well behaved. Great place to hangout on Saturday night.

01-10-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"They have this amazing IPL offer
600 for 4 pints & french fries
Nice ambience
A bit expensive otherwise
The view is really good spanning the whole city"
02-10-2025,15:25:10,No,"Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.

All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!

Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!

During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.

Be aware people. Avoid this place."
03-10-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.
The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.
Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799.
They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.
The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.

The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.

Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.
The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.
Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.
The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.
Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
The chicken tikka pockets were dry.
The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.
Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.
The music was extremely loud for the place.
Overall we had a below average Experience.

Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5"
04-10-2025,17:25:10,No,"Been here with office colleagues, overall a good place to hangout with a gang. But the sitting arrangements during day time is very tight as people would want to dine inside rather than out in the hot sun.

The food was excellent in taste, The chicken dum biriyani had a very different taste and I loved it."

11-10-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"We went for a birthday party, we ordered the drinks , the alcohol was very less so I called the bearer, informed about my issue. And guess what he said ‚ÄúApke paise se Bacardi or coke hi milega ‚Äú and drink was for 349, what I paid for that drink!

Although the manager was sweet enough to get me another drink."
12-10-2025,01:25:10,No,"Simple and elegant ambience ,
Polite staff ,
Food was really good ,
Especially the non-veg platter must try theme !
Comfortable seating .
They really make the best and must try cocktails, they just enjoy serving their new trials with cocktails , served as complimentary for me when they tried it and the immediate minute it‚Äôs worth an order of it !"
13-10-2025,02:25:10,Yes,Its a decent place for dinner. Decors and the service is average but the food is good. And the bar is fully loaded with great drinks. And the offers are also very attractive.
14-10-2025,03:25:10,No,"Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."
15-10-2025,04:25:10,Yes,I had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place. We were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation (it separates balcony from the bar). We told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing. You don't have to worry about anything. Till that time we had ordered our food. But seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out.
16-10-2025,05:25:10,No,"We have ordered Mutton Galouti, Chholey calzone, Pesto roast vegetables pizza and Penne arrabiata (chicken). The detailed review are as follows:
Mutton Galouti: Enriched with spices, made up of succulent meat. Don't try if you don't like spicy food.
Chholey calzone: A treat to the taste buds. Kulcha pockets filled with chholey.
Pesto roast vegetables pizza: A thin crust pizza with adequate amount of toppings.
Penne arrabiata ( chicken added separately ): Nice cheesy pasta loaded with vegetables and chicken.
Nice ambience and satisfactory service."

The food was good. Full marks for presentation.
The service was great.
The ambience was good.

All in all, it's a good place to hangout. I'd rate food 3/5 though.
Ambience 4/5.
Location 4/5."
23-10-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Crap food, less varities, and no drinks in buffets. Not recommended at all. Not recommended at all. Not recommended at all. Not recommended at all."
24-10-2025,13:25:10,No,"Had a great time dining at hyper local. The Non-veg platter, chicken tikka and Assorted wings,were very tasty all food.. Our server for the day, Nitish Kumar was very prompt and friendly."
25-10-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"One of the worst restaurants in Hyderabad. Very bad service and they didn‚Äôt have most of the things that they specified on their menu card. Took friend for lunch there thinking to have good time, but was one of the worst times."
26-10-2025,15:25:10,No,"Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"
27-10-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.
Recommended!!!"
28-10-2025,17:25:10,No,I tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 2+2 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well. The waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. Then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in Hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don‚Äôt speak Hindi. Of course we left immediately and don‚Äôt think that will ever come back.
29-10-2025,18:25:10,Yes,I went there two times both for lunch.. first time food was very tasty and service was great but second time there was a little rush which detoriated the quality of food and service both a little bit. But overall nice place and a must visit
30-10-2025,19:25:10,No,"Situated at the top floor of SLN terminus along with food court area.
Ambience and decor is pleasing.
Buffet doesn't do justice to price paid in terms of variety and service. We had to wait for bowls, spoons and refill of chutney etc.
They serve one veg soup, 2 veg starter, Live pasta which was also not upto the mark, 3 curry, Rice,biryani and different bread option. Gulabjamun and ice cream in dessert."
31-10-2025,20:25:10,Yes,Nice and friendly place. Food was tasty and delicious. Service was very slow. Not able to manage for a bigger crowd of 15 people. Overall a decent place for food.
01-11-2025,21:25:10,No,"This place is within the SLN mall in Gachibowli. We took the outdoor seating, the ambience is fantastic. Had couple of bears with fries, chilli paneer, dahi kabab and spring rolls. The chilli paneer was very tasty , kabab a bit sweet for my taste buds. I feel the good options can be increased, overall good experience."
02-11-2025,22:25:10,Yes,"U will not find many veg items here. But the biryani quantity wise, it will be adequate quantity for both people. We ordered green veg gulati (not so good) and one veg biryani."

13-11-2025,09:25:10,No,"Twisted Mango, Mango famous within summer season. This summer you had Mango or not? Guys you should taste this mango flavor. I am sure mango lover will like this."

Amount 5/5 It will be hard to finish by only one person.

I already had three times by now and having more.

15-11-2025,11:25:10,No,Just because of a silly reason your customer care executives are talking about rules and ruthlessly saying customer has to bear the costs for uber mistake.
16-11-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Staff is very polite and helpful.
Services provided is simply amazing.
Decor is comfortable.
The menu contains variety of flavours and each one of them has unique taste to offer.
Prices are pretty decent.

Do try their Tiramisu Chocolate & Hot Choco Fudge. I wish if they served more quantity in the same price."
17-11-2025,13:25:10,No,"Had the best of icreams at #creamstoneüç®. We went there around 2 in the morning. .
They have different flavours to pic from. We had alfanso, fruit exotica and ferrero rocher. Exquisite desserts with unique taste. I loved the alphanso. They chopped these mangos over the yummy icecream.
Highly recommended. üòá"
18-11-2025,14:25:10,Yes,We Ordered alphonso ice cream.. we got it with only 2-3 pieces of mango.... This is not expected from cream stone. As we r regular customer.
19-11-2025,15:25:10,No,Willy Wonka is my favourite. It is so Delicious and so chocolatey. The taste is so good and the choco chips are so crunchy. And the Brownie is so good. Totally it is Fab
20-11-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"This place is heaven for ice cream lovers... Used to visit this place Everytime after having biryani in paradise... ü§™.. Best part abt them is, they prepare orders on stone counter only so u see things live happening..."

23-11-2025,19:25:10,No,I ordered death by chocolate ice cream and as expected the taste was awesome and the best part was the delivery packing it was so nice that ice cream did not melt a bit also. Overall a good experience.
24-11-2025,20:25:10,Yes,"The ice cream is really good, the ambiance is cute and the staff is courteous, no complaints as such. I like my ice cream to be a little subtle sweet but would highly recommend this to all the ice cream lovers."
25-11-2025,21:25:10,No,"Do I have to write something about this? Ofcourse, all of us love it. I especially love their Alphonso mango üòã. Really like their nutella brownie as well."
26-11-2025,22:25:10,Yes,I liked the way they present and the staff were all ladies who prepared the order. Ice cream was too good that I felt better than naturals at that time. I ordered fresh fruits and nuts and it was amazing.
27-11-2025,23:25:10,No,"Rich taste. Exotic flavours !!

It‚Äôs my favourite place for desserts and birthday cakes

Would definitely recommend everyone to try their ice cream cakes !!"
28-11-2025,00:25:10,Yes,"Very good concept and unique flavours ! My personal favourite is fruit exotica and tiramisu , would certainly again and again just to have these two flavours.

Eagerly waiting for season special Alphonso ice cream !"
29-11-2025,01:25:10,No,"I've had a number of ice creams here, and all the time they're different flavours, but nothing can beat their forever amazing brownie break. Absolutely love it."
30-11-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"When you‚Äôre craving ice cream and a burst of fresh fruit and nutty flavours, Cream stone is my go to. I always order the green apple ice cream with nuts but when I placed an online order that wasn‚Äôt available. So I picked the fruit and nut overload and it was heavenly. The rich texture if the ice cream combined with the fresh nuts is a delight. Cream stone can never go wrong!
Taste: 5/5
Service: 5/5"
01-12-2025,03:25:10,No,Had their nutella brownie ice cream in a cup. Great tasting. It got delivered with proper packaging and dry ice. Great to the taste. Just wish they were priced bit lower :) Will definitely try their other offerings.

03-12-2025,05:25:10,No,"I have ordered nuts loaded ice cream and also dry fruit ice cream. Really both ice creams taste was worst. They have added more anjeer rather than other dry fruits.Really I didn't feel like I am eating ice cream because of anjeer. I never going to order ice cream from cream stone. People who wants ice cream taste don't go for cream stone dry fruit, nuts overloaded and Afghan ice cream.price also not reasonable."
04-12-2025,06:25:10,Yes,Its a awsm experience...i just love creamstone's ice cream..very fast delivery nd never delayed me order....i wish it will remain same..ice creams are so tasty and once someone order frm here am damn sure they never think to go to another icecream shop to eat icecream.
05-12-2025,07:25:10,No,My fav past time and this is mine nd my bestie‚Äôs favourite place to chill out. I do order any tine required and their delivery packaging is even quite good. Best part is it is opened till 1 am

08-12-2025,10:25:10,Yes,"Doesnt entertain ordered placed through food ordering apps. Had to wait for 45 mins before cancelling the order. I even talked to the cashier.
After assuring the order will be ready in sometime, there was no update."
09-12-2025,11:25:10,No,"I did not have a good experience here. The service wasn't good. The ice cream looked good, but I didn't like the taste. Too many nuts. The listing in the menu was a bit misleading, and didn't have anything mentioned about nuts."
10-12-2025,12:25:10,Yes,"Great taste, Nice quality, Affordable prices, Effective varities, plus Zomato on time delivery. I order here almost daily. Only problem with this place is Caution : you will get addicted for sure."
11-12-2025,13:25:10,No,If you are an ice-cream lover you might have already been here. Cream stone is one of the best places to get many variety flavoured ice-creams at anytime.
12-12-2025,14:25:10,Yes,"I am wondering if I had ordered thick shake or an ice cream.. thick shake will have better consistency than this.. most of my previous orders were in the same condition, yet I gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand .. NOT ANY MORE. Spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.

I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. I place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes. Despite of the distance and presence of dry ice, the ice cream melted completely."
13-12-2025,15:25:10,No,"The quality is good,
But found hair in my order which is not good , please be sure the food is good while delivering it !!!!!
Hope it would be better next time !!"
14-12-2025,16:25:10,Yes,"I used to crave for the place before I visit, and now it seems the waiting was worthy. In each bite I can feel the delicacy. But we had full stomach when we ordered fruit overloaded and chocolava. But I would suggest for one for two people."
15-12-2025,17:25:10,No,Awesome ice cream shop. Had waffle nutcracker and lichi lake. Would recommend to all. Taste was good and quite budget friendly. Try out magic pops if you have not tried before.
16-12-2025,18:25:10,Yes,"Though busy but an awesome place to hang out. Grab some delicious combinations of chocolate & Nutty ice-creams, shakes, waffles and you could probably have the best ice-creams to satisfy your cravings."
17-12-2025,19:25:10,No,"One of my favourite cream stone. Loved the taste with brownie ""Chocovala"". I was completely satisfied with the Chocovala . I will suggest this to my friends, they can also enjoy this same feeling."
18-12-2025,20:25:10,Yes,#Masti time helped a lot ... Refreshing memories #Office time best choice for the ice cream shops nearby Gachibowli ! Do try Death by Chocolate üòãüòã
19-12-2025,21:25:10,No,"As we all know that cream stone is a good place for hangout and it's quite famous for best ice cream.

I love this place and I was in my office so we are thinking to order but again we decided to go there and have fun.

So me and my friends was started our trip and it was a fun while reaching there.

We reach there and have some stone ice cream it was a really good concept of making ice cream on stone and it was a perfect way to make because I have seen many place of making stone ice cream but it was totally different and perfect way .

We enjoyed our night at cream stone and it was really good time with my friend at cream stone."
20-12-2025,22:25:10,Yes,Look at the quantity of icecream charging 175 and the product should be worth to it right ......and the brownie is not at all backed its completed rock chilled
21-12-2025,23:25:10,No,"I am a huge fan of Cream Stone's Death by Chocolate ice cream. I've never personally been there, and I always got it delivered.
The packing is always so amazing. It's one box of chocolate cake with loaded chocolate sauce and another box that has a mix of vanilla and chocolate ice cream.
It's a must try for all the chocolate lovers out there."
22-12-2025,00:25:10,Yes,Cool place which will be available till 1pm in HYD beat icreams and very unique especially they have wide range of varieties in chocolate types and service is also quite good except their GM singing in the outlet :p
23-12-2025,01:25:10,No,"The best shop worth to buy desserts. I brought a caramel sutra. Its osssssom!!!
From packing, delivering to food taste, everything is fine....
My first order after reaching Hyderabad!!"
24-12-2025,02:25:10,Yes,"Visited this place a while back. Their ice creams are totally worth it! I'd suggest try their listed sundaes rather than make a custom one: the pre-listed choices are just so much better. the only issue is their seating space is a little less, so we took our ice creams to go. But would recommend it just for the taste."
25-12-2025,03:25:10,No,"I had Dry Fruit Overload ice cream from this outlet. It was the most amazing experience I had on that day. If I have to order an ice cream again, I will surely choose Cream Stone again. Damn, it was so amazing! I am out of words right now."
26-12-2025,04:25:10,Yes,Interior is good but small one and quality of ice cream also good but some of the items like chocolate u can't eat alone bcz of it Sweetness
27-12-2025,05:25:10,No,I am not happy the way it is managed. No proper response from the workers. My order was not yet prepared and these people are not ready to replace my 1 order out of 10+ items which I have orders . These people are not working for customer satisfaction. They are working for only money. Not at all happy this time.
28-12-2025,06:25:10,Yes,The more you have the more you crave. One of the best icecream concepts ever. The way they serve icecream blended in the taste itself is just awesome
29-12-2025,07:25:10,No,I had gone to this place and ordered nutty overload icecream and chocolate icecream with waffles. The nutty overload icecream was really good.
30-12-2025,08:25:10,Yes,"Ordered Nuts Overloaded. Tasted like nothing you could have ever tasted. With every bite of the ice-cream, you get loads of nut in your mouth.
Cream Stone has variety of self made ice creams which will make you feel special.(Ye Maine kuch bhi likh diya, couldn't think of what to write.)"
31-12-2025,09:25:10,No,"Cream stone is already aware brand chain as we all know and their quality and making of icecream and shakes are super and every one should try once, its costly but the quality also high"
01-01-2026,10:25:10,Yes,I have ordered willy Wonka for home delivery.. It became over frozen by the time I received the same.. I did a complain and very next day Cream stone sent another ice cream for free.. Keep up ur good service
02-01-2026,11:25:10,No,"Cream stone is just an amazing place to have some dessert. They have almost all the flavors that you can ask for in icecreams. They have Shakes, Waffles, ice creams, sundaes and what not.

The ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoples.

I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.

Must try if you have a sweet tooth!!!"
03-01-2026,12:25:10,Yes,"Ordered Fruit exotica and fruit and nuts ice-cream on two different days, once from swiggy and once from zomato. The ice-creams were both melted and lacked the flavour and quality that is usually offered by cream stone. Highy DISAPPOINTED!! I was a fan of cream stone ice-creams but I won't recommend this to anyone ever again. Not worth spending money on."
04-01-2026,13:25:10,No,"A must try for all the ice cream lover. Loved Thier way of Delivering the ice cream, they put ice in the packet , which they deliver ice cream, so it can remain frozen, Awesome Concept, loved it. You could try all menu , but personal favourite is Willy Wonka. Do give it a try guys !"
05-01-2026,14:25:10,Yes,"Ordered fruit exotica and I don't know what the hell is this ice cream but sure it's not what I ordered , not the experience what I wanted but that was indeed a surprise"
06-01-2026,15:25:10,No,"We ordered fruit exotica, it was worth the money. Had many fruits overloaded into it. Had many seasonal fruits along with other fruits. Can try this anytime."
07-01-2026,16:25:10,Yes,"One of my Weekend chill out place!!
My favourite ice creams are
Nuts overloaded,
Arabian nights,
Dry Fruit Delight,
Ferrero Rocher,
Fruit Exotica,"
08-01-2026,17:25:10,No,"One busy place especially in the evenings.
Cream stone has created a special place for itself since beginning. All the ice creams are tasty and the mix ins.

Wide range of ice creams , cream blends, home made waffle bowls and cones makes it unique.

My personal fav are alphonso Mango icecream, death by chocolate and brownie break.

One good stop for ice cream lovers"
09-01-2026,18:25:10,Yes,Taste was pathetic....I didn't like it.... Roadside ice cream would be better than this.
10-01-2026,19:25:10,No,very good... on time delivery
11-01-2026,20:25:10,Yes,"It was great but,the standards have lowered. My choco lava was like Stone and ice cream was like cream!!! Anusha has done the worst jobü§ê
I now don't prefer this place.There are much better places where people at least listen when you say how your ice cream is looking."
12-01-2026,21:25:10,No,Best place for ice cream in the area. The ambience is also nice. The nutty concepts range of ice cream is a must try. The rates are higher but the quality is good.
13-01-2026,22:25:10,Yes,Best ever ice cream I have ever had for the last few years and I have a lot of people who feel like me. Ijust love you so much for the great ice cream you have made for me.
14-01-2026,23:25:10,No,I loved the taste of qvality of ice cream and i love the response of the restaurant and its delecious mostily i love the afghan nuts ice cream
15-01-2026,00:25:10,Yes,Wonderful place for ice creams. My favorite. Would recommend this place to my friends and family. Great ambience. Great taste and consistency of the ice creams is very good.
16-01-2026,01:25:10,No,quantity was less
17-01-2026,02:25:10,Yes,ice cream got melted even before reaching me...my place is 5 min from creamstone.
18-01-2026,03:25:10,No,"Nice place. Staffs are friendly and create great icecream experience.

Location is perfect just in the heart of Gachibowli. One of the favourite hangout places for people."
19-01-2026,04:25:10,Yes,ordered nuts overloaded ice cream.fantastic taste.
20-01-2026,05:25:10,No,Delivery was before time. 5 star for delivery person
21-01-2026,06:25:10,Yes,Cream stone is the best hangout place when it comes to late-night drives . Only issue is the place can become a bit crowded and order takes a bit extra time to come
22-01-2026,07:25:10,No,"Its a creamstone, what can I say. Goodnicecream is my weakness. But this branch has just become super busy. Can you see how many zomato guys have lined up for the order."
23-01-2026,08:25:10,Yes,"Well, I love, love, love ALL the icecreams here. Having said that, I have my favourites. Three to be precise. Death by Chocolate, Chocolate Overdose and Karamel Sutra. When I am on a diet, I get their diet fruit concept icecream- I am that mad about their icecreams. This is one of those places where I gawk on my food and forget to click pictures."
24-01-2026,09:25:10,No,It's too crowded with delivery executives all the time.. Don't find place to sit mostly. It'd be better if they provide some way out. Preferable to online order than physical visit.
25-01-2026,10:25:10,Yes,"Cream stone is always best but even when the cake that we require is completed they are still showing the cake on online delivery,it can be changed so that customers don't face any trouble"
26-01-2026,11:25:10,No,"Whenever i have a craving for ice creams, cream stone is the solution! I am a coffee lover so the first thing that i tried here is Coffee craze. The taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts. The next thing that i tried here is the Chocolate overdose. It's a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie. The icecreams are extremely rich and intense. Overall, i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours."
27-01-2026,12:25:10,Yes,"I could not finish ice cream at all. Not at all good.
Never like the place.. as specially, sitafal taste is very very bad. Very crowdy place, but taste is not at all good."
28-01-2026,13:25:10,No,"Goo blend of ice cream. Good flavours as well. They have many varieties in fruit and chocolate flavors. Try ice cram, but big NO for waffles. They are very hard."
29-01-2026,14:25:10,Yes,Poor Service. Have ordered ice cream and it took 1 hour to reach me..by the time when it reached it's not like ice cream it's like milk shake... completely melted. They didn't add solid ice inside the package at all.. too pathetic online delivery service by creamstone gachibowli branch... Never expected this from them because am a big fan of creamstone...it disappointed me badly by it's poor service
30-01-2026,15:25:10,No,"Cream Stone is always a best place if you are found of variety of ice-creams . Been here for many occasions and when we thought of visiting a place in the late night. 

Taste is very good and prices are moderate and variety of the items are so good .

I would definatly recommend all to visit here."
31-01-2026,16:25:10,Yes,"Ordered nutella brownie and got brownie and vanilla ice cream It's a shame that they write the name of the ice cream correct, take the money correct but FAIL TO MAKE the ice cream correct. Not expected from cream stone. Your customers are not fools. Dont insult them by assuming that they are less intelligent."
01-02-2026,17:25:10,No,"I love treating myself to cream stone every once in a while! It's the perfect treat. I've tried almost all their flavors and I love every single one. My favorite would be Willy Wonka (I love chocolate). I'm not fond of their waffles though, but the ice creams are to die for üòã Definitely visit Cream Stone!"
02-02-2026,18:25:10,Yes,good timing
03-02-2026,19:25:10,No,"I have heard a lot about this ice cream parlour from my friends of Hyderabad and Chennai. I didn't miss to visit this place when I was in Hyderabad. I ordered one ferrero rocher. It was like heaven ü§©.
The place is very small for indoor seating. I think , the management should increase their indoor seating arrangement due to their large crowd.

If u r a icecream-lover , this place will be the perfect bliss for you."
04-02-2026,20:25:10,Yes,A perfect dessert for you and a must have surprise gift for your partner üòç Try the Chocolate over dose and enjoy the pure bliss of Chocolate in your mouth üòã can reduce the sugar content a bit ü§î
05-02-2026,21:25:10,No,"It's a ever busy place that reeks of laughter & sugar in the air. The cream stone brand is ever known , but what sets apart gachibowli from others is it's courteous staff & ambient seating area. Its a go to place for ISB, IIIT & HCU students."
06-02-2026,22:25:10,Yes,"Totally recommended for crazy ice snowppl
Ambience 2/5
Taste 5/5
Pocket friendly 3/5
This place is not at all for dine in because of crowd.
There is flavour for every one."
07-02-2026,23:25:10,No,good
08-02-2026,00:25:10,Yes,excellent service
09-02-2026,01:25:10,No,super delevery
10-02-2026,02:25:10,Yes,delivery behaviour good
11-02-2026,03:25:10,No,"I have ordered several times from cream stone.
One of the finest place for ice creams. Quality and taste of ice creams are top notch. You will fall in love with this ice creams"
12-02-2026,04:25:10,Yes,Please look at the below image. This is how I got my order when I order from zomato. I had a confusion to eat it or gulp it. However I gave 2 * for the browny
13-02-2026,05:25:10,No,not ggod
14-02-2026,06:25:10,Yes,"They didn't packed the ice cream nicely ie.. didn't keep any dry ice, because of that it got melted and spreads in the pckage. A bit disappointed other than that taste is good."
15-02-2026,07:25:10,No,ice cream was melted before it reached me and I didn't see dry ice pieces in it either service was too bad
16-02-2026,08:25:10,Yes,"Ice cream was good , but it's totally got melt as delivery boy took a lot of time to reach. He mentioned it as delivered as soon as he picked order. He took nearly 45 minutes to come."
